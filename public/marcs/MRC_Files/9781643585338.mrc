When he collapses on the frozen pond and drowns, could it be the freedom she's never known? With barely a day of peace as a young widow, her cold-hearted stepsons throw her from their father's home. William Gibbs thinks he knows desperation. With the death of their mother, he is left to raise his four younger siblings in their one-room cabin and work their small tobacco farm. On a dark rainy night searching for his missing sister whom many consider an imbecile, Will turns to the local reverend and his wife for help. Their simple solution is to marry off the woman who has been sheltering in their church. Will agrees to take Anna as his wife. Just as the new family finds care and acceptance for one another, Anna is arrested for the murder of her first husband. Moved with his ever growing feelings for his new wife, Will vows to protect her from the ludicrous charges but he has no idea from where help will come"--Provided by publisher. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129459657
