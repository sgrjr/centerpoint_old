So, with a three-year-old daughter to care for and a broken heart to mend, he moved across the country to find a new life in Bridgeport, Ohio. Now he tends bar by night and tries to navigate life as a single dad by day. Luckily, his neighbor is happy to babysit while he works late nights. She's great with little Kate, beautiful, kind and lately he's found himself smiling whenever he thinks about her. Dani Brown also knows what it's like to lose a spouse and raise a child on her own. Cleaning houses during the day, and taking online classes at night, she dreams of running her own preschool someday. And, since her fourteen-year-old son Jeremy's baseball team requires a lot of money, she's thrilled to earn some extra cash by watching her handsome neighbor's adorable little girl. But even with two jobs, she's having trouble making ends meet. When Jackson sees Dani running herself ragged for her son's baseball ambitions, he decides it's time to get the Bridgeport Social Club involved. Together they cook up a plan. They will run a charity poker tournament to support Jeremy's dream and help out a hardworking single mom. But will Dani be able to accept help from the handsome neighbor she's starting to feel more-than-friendly feelings for? And how far is she ready to let those feelings go?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aSingle fathersvFiction. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aNeighborsvFiction. 0aPoker playersvFiction. 0aMale friendshipvFiction. 0aOhiovFiction. 0aBridgeport (Ohio)vFiction. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.1 aGray, Shelley Shepard.tBridgeport Social Club series ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1201657952  c4655d4655
