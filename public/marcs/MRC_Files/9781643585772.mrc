His skylarking however brought trouble in his wake and he decided it best to drift from his home range for a while. Then trouble began in earnest. In the Comal Valley he rode into more of it than he had ever imagined could come to one wandering cowboy in search of adventure. He found Hondo, the desert cowtown of far-flung ill repute, rightly named, when he was framed for bushwhacking and robbery; the killing of the father of the only girl he had ever seen in his life whose voice could twang his heart strings. And for Sanna'a sake, for her revenge on the evil doers, he fought single-handed battles. Men died swiftly and without warning in the bullet-torn Comal Valley. Yet for the sake of one wistful-eyed, sorrowing girl, the Cholla Kid was willing to champion the short-odds end of an ugly range war - and to come out triumphant"--Provided by publisher. 0aCowboysvFiction. 0aRevengevFiction. 0aNew MexicovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1135566915  c4472d4472
