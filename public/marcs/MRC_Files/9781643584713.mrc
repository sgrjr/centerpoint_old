But when he stumbles upon a litter of four motherless kittens, he really has his paws full. The prime suspect in a series of thefts at Storybook Court with two local detectives on his tail, he's determined to sniff out the real thief. But when he gets a whiff of romance in the air, he can't resist a little matchmaking, too. One of the detectives seems awfully fond of the aspiring actress who moved into the neighborhood. And his partner looks like she could use a hug, too. With a little help from those adorable kittens, Mac is sure that love will save the day"--Provided by publisher. 0aCatsvFiction. 0aCat ownersvFiction. 0aThievesvFiction. 0aDating (Social customs)vFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1122800618
