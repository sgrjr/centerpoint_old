The dead girl is carrying an ID that will put this crime at the center of a scandal--her card identifies her as Carline Darcy, heir apparent to Darcy Therapeutics, Ireland's most successful pharmaceutical company. Darcy Therapeutics has a finger in every pie, from sponsoring university research facilities to funding political parties to philanthropy--it has even funded Emma's own ground-breaking research. As the murder investigation twists in unexpected ways and Cormac's running of the case comes under scrutiny from the department and his colleagues, he is forced to question himself and the beliefs that he has long held as truths"--Provided by publisher. 0aPharmaceutical industryvFiction. 0aWomen scientistsvFiction. 0aGalway (Ireland)vFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122802490
