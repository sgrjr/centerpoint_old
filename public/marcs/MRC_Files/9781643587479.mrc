And tote 'em in your hands, not on your hips, so everybody can see you're loaded." It was advice worth heeding, for Beaumont was a wild and woolly town. Spindletop was in; and roughs, toughs, petty thieves, gamblers, soldiers of fortune and professional gunslingers rubbed elbows and took advantage of the oil strike. Wade Rawlins rode into the booming frontier town and had no trouble getting a job as a dealer in the Alhambra Saloon. But this was only a way station for him on the route to more grandiose horizons. Bet-A-Million Gates and other legendary figures of the period lend color and authenticity to this lusty novel of the Texas Panhandle."--cProvided by publisher. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifevFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1193118528  c4652d4652
