As she arrives at the convent where Frederic teaches piano, she watches in horror as Gestapo officers execute Frederic for hiding a Jewish girl in the piano. Lana is overcome with grief. That evening, she loses the baby. A few months later, Lana is approached by a member of the resistance to serve as a spy on the French Riviera. Lana is a "White Russian," the daughter of a Russian countess, making her ideal to infiltrate the emigre community of Russian aristocrats who socialize with German officers. The Gestapo officer in charge, Alois Brunner, the same man who shot Frederic, is intent on exterminating all the Jews. Her cover story makes her the mistress of a wealthy Swiss industrialist named Guy Pascal, in whose villas she stays . Their information-gathering at parties allows them to thwart several raids, helping members of the Jewish population escape to North Africa. But Lana doesn't count on becoming attached to a young Jewish girl named Odette, who has just lost her father. Nor does she intend to feel an attraction to Guy so soon after the loss of her husband. As the Nazis' efforts intensify, her desire to protect those around her may instead put them all at risk"--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen spiesvFiction. 0aHusbandsxDeathvFiction. 0aNazisvFiction. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aRevengevFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xUnderground movementsvFiction. 0aRiviera (France)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1225190306  c4732d4732
