Saving the life of pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Aria Sinclair on Denali helped too. Now he can't get her out of his head, and when he hears she is in the path of a hurricane down in Key West he can't help but jump on a plane to rescue her. Aria has dedicated her life to helping children born with defective hearts. After all, she was one of those children. Now driven to succeed, she lives a lonely, stressful life. One she would have lost on Denali if it hadn't been for Jake. Jake is exciting and handsome, but he's also dangerous, and she's already lost one person she loves. She can't bear it again. It's not until she finds herself trapped in the middle of a category 4 hurricane that she can admit she needs Jake desperately. With their very survival in the balance, can they hope for a second chance at life . . . and love?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aMountaineering expeditionszAlaskavFiction. 0aHurricanesvFiction. 0aSearch and rescue operationsvFiction. 0aSurvivalvFiction. 0aHeart surgeonsvFiction. 0aVeteransvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aDenali National Park and Preserve (Alaska)vFiction. 0aChristian fiction. 0aLarge type books.1 aWarren, Susan May,d1966-tGlobal search and rescue ;v2.  c(OCoLC)1193111527  c4635d4635
