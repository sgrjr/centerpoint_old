She's accepted that her future won't be what she'd dreamed, but now, as gentrification has completely reshaped her old neighborhood, even her past is unrecognizable. Old haunts have been razed, and wealthy white strangers have replaced every familiar face in Bed-Stuy. Even her mother, Mirella, has abandoned the family to reclaim her roots in the Dominican Republic. That took courage. It's also unforgivable. When Penelope moves into the attic apartment of the affluent Harpers, she thinks she's found a semblance of family, and maybe even love. But her world is upended again when she receives a postcard from Mirella asking for reconciliation. As old wounds are reopened, and secrets revealed, a journey across an ocean of sacrifice and self-discovery begins. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aWomen artistsvFiction. 0aFathersxCarevFiction. 0aDominicans (Dominican Republic)vFiction. 0aBrooklyn (New York, N.Y.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1029568439  aC0bDON
