It had been a costly, bitter blow, but now Banner had a young filly that showed the same promise. It would take every last cent he had to qualify for the All-American Futurity at Ruidosa Downs, and every bit of faith he could muster. Lee Banner wondered if he wasn't crazy to dream again ... and knew he had no choice"--Provided by publisher. 0aHorse breedersvFiction. 0aHorse racingvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1113419917
