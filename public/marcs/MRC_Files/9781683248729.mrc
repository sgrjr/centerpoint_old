Now, surrounded by family, she's finally found peace and a promising career opportunity--until her babysitter is killed and her neighbor asks her to defend his son, Nick, who stands accused of the murder. Tessa was the ultimate girl next door, and the community is outraged by her death. But Morgan has known Nick for years and can't believe he's guilty, despite the damning evidence stacked against him. She asks her friend Lance Kruger, an ex-cop turned private eye, for help. Taking on the town, the police, and a zealous DA, Morgan and Lance plunge into the investigation, determined to find the real killer. But as they uncover secrets that rock the community, they become targets for the madman hiding in plain sight." 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aWomen lawyersvFiction. 0aWidowszNew York (State)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomantic suspense fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  aBrodartbBRODn122309634  c(OCoLC)1038250305
