Although it flies against all the conventions for women of the time, they're determined to make their own way in the world. But once they arrive in the Caribbean, proper gender roles are the least of their concerns. On the infamous island of Nevis, the sisters discover the legacy of the legendary sugar barons has vastly declined--and that's just the start of what their eyes are opened to in this unfamiliar world."--cProvided by publisher. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aMate selectionvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1015269857
