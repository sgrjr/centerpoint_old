But he fulfills the promise he made when their twins were born seven years earlier: to raise Jabin and Chloe should tragedy strike. Still, coping with the children's grief as well as his own, requires extra support. He's surprised to find an Amish farm that offers just that. Hope Graber had to find a way to save the family farm after her daed's health forced him to stop breeding horses. Providing animal therapy proved to be the answer-thanks to the help of expert trainer Logan Russell. Together, they not only pay the bills, they make positive changes in children's lives. Hope loves working with each child, but she takes a special interest in the Miller twins. She even makes Micah smile again-and he does the same for her. In fact, as Micah emerges from his depression, he longs to make them one happy family. But will Hope's debt to her Englisch trainer, and their close partnership, stand in the way?"-- Provided by publisher. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aOrphansvFiction. 0aAnimal trainersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142521341  c4526d4526
