Her intentions come to a screeching halt when a skeleton is found behind a makeshift wall-an axe beside it. Something ghastly from the past has come back to haunt the Darkwater Inn. As Adelaide works alongside owner Dimitri Pampalon and Detective Beau Savoie, the two men who have been pursuing her heart, she learns the eerie death has tentacles that reach deep into the seedy past of both the Darkwater Inn and the evil underground of New Orleans. The past and the present collide as the stakes are upped-not only for Adelaide's heart, but for her very life and her father's life as well. The threats are deadly, the coils of evil are tightening around everyone involved, and they are more powerful than anyone could have ever imagined"--Provided by publisher. 0aLodging-housesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aTriangles (Interpersonal relations)vFiction. 0aNew Orleans (La.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aRomantic suspense fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122803104
