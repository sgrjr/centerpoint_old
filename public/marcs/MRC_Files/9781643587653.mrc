She's finally created a life with her daughter and is a well-respected attorney. She's moving on. But when a new rash of homicides has her ex-husband, Eddie, written all over them - the nightmares of her past come back to life. The FBI asks Jessica to get involved in the hunt for this copycat killer - which means visiting her ex and collaborating with the man who tore her life apart. As the copycat's motives become clearer, the new life Jessica created for herself gets darker. She must ask herself who she can trust and if she's capable of stopping the killer - a man whose every crime is a bloody valentine from a twisted mastermind she's afraid she may never escape."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen lawyersvFiction. 0aPublic prosecutorsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aSerial murderersvFiction. 0aDivorced peoplevFiction.10aUnited States.bFederal Bureau of InvestigationvFiction. 0aNevadavFiction. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201657355  c4663d4663
