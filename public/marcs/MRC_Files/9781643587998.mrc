The expedition pushed technology to the limits, mapped hidden landscapes, discovered previously unknown life forms and began to piece together how life in the deep oceans affects our planet -- but it was far from easy. Vescovo and his team would design the most advanced deep-diving submersible ever built, able to withstand the deep ocean's pressure on the sub of 8 tons per square inch -- the equivalent of having 292 fueled and fully loaded 747s stacked on top of it. The hurricane-laden ocean waters and the byzantine web of global oceanographic politics only heightened the challenges. 0aOceanographyxResearch. 0aSubmarine trenches. 0aOceanography. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225189348  c4692d4692
