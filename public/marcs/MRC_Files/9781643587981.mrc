Now, in She Come by It Natural, originally published in a four-part series for The Journal of Roots Music, No Depression, Smarsh explores the overlooked contributions to social progress by such women -- including those averse to the term "feminism" -- as exemplified by Dolly Parton's life and art. Far beyond the recently resurrected "Jolene" or quintessential "9 to 5," Parton's songs for decades have validated women who go unheard: the poor woman, the pregnant teenager, the struggling mother disparaged as "trailer trash." Parton's broader career -- from singing on the front porch of her family's cabin in the Great Smoky Mountains to achieving stardom in Nashville and Hollywood, from "girl singer" managed by powerful men to leader of a self-made business and philanthropy empire -- offers a springboard to examining the intersections of gender, class, and culture.10aParton, DollyxCriticism and interpretation. 0aCountry musicxHistory and criticism. 0aWomen in music. 7aMusic criticism and reviews.2lcgft 7aBiographies.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225191469  c4691d4691
