Running the small town newspaper, Anna McDowell can't escape the grim reports from the other side of the world, but home-front challenges abound as well. Dr. Daniel is serving the wounded on the front lines. And Katy, expecting her first child, with her husband in the trenches, tries to support the war effort with her Red Cross club. Even as the war winds down the costs are high -- and Sunset Cove is not spared."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aMothers and daughterszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918vFiction. 0aInfluenza Epidemic, 1918-1919vFiction. 0aOregonxSocial life and customsy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201684309  c4682d4682
