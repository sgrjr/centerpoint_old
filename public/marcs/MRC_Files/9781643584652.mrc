But his simple plan to restore his family's inheritance leaves him driving away from Lennhurst Asylum, elbow to elbow with a beautiful patient in his charge--an unstable, madcap young woman who is the legal heir to his land. Patience Stevens spins with the adventure of leaving Lennhurst to find her childhood trees, lake and land. Confident to face the dark unknowns that took place there, she dreams of gardens and woodland homes for all her winged friends. Fortifying herself to face the horrors one by one, the revelations of her past collides with a new struggle in the form of handsome Reed Chapman. He seems overly concerned with her wellbeing and suddenly her heart is taken with his attention"--Provided by publisher. 0aInheritance and successionvFiction. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122799415
