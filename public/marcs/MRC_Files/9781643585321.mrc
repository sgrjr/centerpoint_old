His coworker, start-up expert Kimberly Foster, is brilliant, fearless, and capable, but years of personal rejection have left her defensive and longing for a family. Two people have never been more at odds -- or more attracted to one another. And every day at work, the sparks sure do fly. When Kimberly's ambitious plans for Sam's ministry butt up against his risk-averse nature, Sam decides that obligations to family trump his work for the church. He quits the ministry and heads home to Australia to help his sister, Jules, save her struggling farm. As Kimberly's grand plans flounder, she is forced to face the truth: that no one can replace Sam. Together they strike up a deal: if Kimberly comes to work on Jules's dairy farm and lends her business brains to their endeavor, then maybe -- just maybe -- Sam will reconsider his future with the church"--Provided by publisher. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aClergyvFiction. 0aBusinesswomenvFiction. 0aFamily farmszAustraliavFiction. 0aAustraliavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129458509
