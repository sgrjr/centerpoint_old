Stephan's best friend and companion is the brilliant ÈZofie-Helene, a Christian girl whose mother edits a progressive, anti-Nazi newspaper. But the two adolescents' carefree innocence is shattered when the Nazis' take control. There is hope in the darkness, though. Truus Wijsmuller, a member of the Dutch resistance, risks her life smuggling Jewish children out of Nazi Germany to the nations that will take them. It is a mission that becomes even more dangerous after the Anschluss - Hitler's annexation of Austria - as, across Europe, countries close their borders to the growing number of refugees desperate to escape. Tante Truus, as she is known, is determined to save as many children as she can. After Britain passes a measure to take in at-risk child refugees from the German Reich, she dares to approach Adolf Eichmann, the man who would later help devise the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question," in a race against time to bring children like Stephan, his young brother Walter, and ÈZofie-Helene on a perilous journey to an uncertain future abroad"--Provided by publisher. 0aKindertransports (Rescue operations)vFiction. 0aJewszAustriazViennavFiction. 0aJewish childrenvFiction. 0aJewish refugeesvFiction. 0aVienna (Austria)xHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1135582677  c4446d4446
