The human system for processing sound is a biological marvel, an intricate assembly of delicate membranes, bones, receptor cells, and neurons. Yet many people take their ears for granted, abusing them with loud restaurants, rock concerts, and Q-tips. And then, eventually, most of us start to go deaf. Millions of Americans suffer from hearing loss. Faced with the cost and stigma of hearing aids, the natural human tendency is to do nothing and hope for the best, usually while pretending that nothing is wrong. In Volume Control, David Owen argues this inaction comes with a huge social cost. He demystifies the science of hearing and the remarkable technologies that can help us hear better while encouraging readers to get the treatment they need for hearing loss and protect the hearing they still have"--Provided by publisher. 0aDeafness. 0aHearing aids. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1129460139
