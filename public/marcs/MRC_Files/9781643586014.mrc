But with a daring jailbreak getting the town in a dither again, she knows that the danger hasn't passed for anyone in her coastal hometown. With a mayoral election keeping tensions high and the authorities busy searching for those behind the jailbreak, Anna has plenty to keep the newspaper busy. But when her sixteen-year-old daughter begins making noises about leaving high school and abandoning dreams of college, Anna realizes that prohibition isn't the only thing she needs to be worrying about. How deep does the root of corruption run in their town? As she digs deeper, Anna is forced to put the concerns of her own heart on hold in an effort to save some of the people dearest to her"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aMothers and daughterszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aPolitical corruptionzOregonvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aCities and townszOregonvFiction. 0aNineteen tensvFiction. 0aOregonxSocial life and customsy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1137841616  c4492d4492
