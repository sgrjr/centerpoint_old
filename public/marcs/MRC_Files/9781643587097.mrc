Except midsummer heat waves and outdoor ceremonies don't mix, and an exasperated Bailey soon finds herself struggling to fulfill bridesmaid duties and keep her stunning marshmallow-frosted wedding cake from becoming a gooey disaster. Then much to everyone's shock, the entire ceremony crumbles when a guest drops dead, and the cause isn't sunstroke. Turns out, the uninvited victim came equipped with lots of dirt on the devout reverend's hidden past. As Reverend Brook tops the murder suspect list on what should have been the happiest day of his life, Bailey and her sheriff's deputy boyfriend vow to clear his name. Can the duo boil down a series of baffling clues before Juliet considers her marriage a bad mistake-or the killer whips up another deadly surprise?"--Provided by publisher.10aKing, Baileyc(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aMarriagevFiction. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aBusinesspeoplevFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aOhiovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aCozy mysteries.2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aFlower, Amanda.tAmish candy shop mystery ;v5.  c(OCoLC)1193111508  c4588d4588
