When the Texans return with reinforcements, another confrontation ends with one of the Texans being killed. Gitalong is encouraged to leave town until the Texans have moved on, only to be seriously injured in a stage accident. When it appears the accident was no accident and some of the Texans are found on wanted posters, Marshall Fred Nolan begins to wonder if there is a connection between them and the bullion coach he and his deputies are to escort through his area"--Provided by publisher. 0aUnited States marshalsvFiction. 0aDroversvFiction. 0aMurdervFiction. 0aDakota TerritoryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 0aCircle V western.  c(OCoLC)1128200050
