Knopf, an imprint of The Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.  a"Bunny Lampert is the princess of the North Shore -- beautiful, tall, blond, with a rich real-estate developer father and a swimming pool in her backyard. Michael -- with a ponytail down his back and a septum piercing -- lives with his aunt in the cramped stucco cottage next door. When Bunny catches Michael smoking in her yard, he discovers her life isn't as perfect as it seems. At six foot three, Bunny towers over their classmates. Even as she dreams of standing out and competing in the Olympics, she is desperate to fit in, to seem normal, and to get a boyfriend, all while hiding her father's escalating alcoholism. Michael has secrets of his own. At home and at school Michael pretends to be straight, but at night he tries to understand himself by meeting men online for anonymous encounters that both thrill and scare him. When Michael falls in love for the first time, a vicious strain of gossip circulates and a terrible, brutal act becomes the defining feature of both his and Bunny's futures -- and their friendship."--cProvided by publisher. 0aTeenage girlsvFiction. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aFriendship in adolescencevFiction. 0aCloseted gaysvFiction. 0aNorth Shore (Calif.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193125640  c4630d4630
