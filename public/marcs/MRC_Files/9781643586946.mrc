In this book, the capstone of her long career, Thomas, now eighty-eight, turns her keen eye to her own life. The result is an account of growing old that is at once funny and charming and intimate and profound, both a memoir and a life-affirming map all of us may follow to embrace our later years with grace and dignity. A charmingly intimate account and a broad look at the social and historical traditions related to aging, Growing Old explores a wide range of issues connected with growing older, from stereotypes of the elderly as burdensome to the methods of burial humans have used throughout history to how to deal with a concerned neighbor who assumes you're buying cat food to eat for dinner."--Provided by publisher.10aThomas, Elizabeth Marshall,d1931- 0aOlder womenzUnited StatesvBiography. 0aAgingzUnited States. 0aOlder peoplezUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy21st century. 0aLarge type books. 7aBiographies.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193114773  c4573d4573
