Actually Hap was the son of the upright rancher Warren Allen, who had been killed by bushwack bullets, while Everett's father was the ruffianly cattle thief, Dev Hewett. The boys were ignorant of their own identity until they came of age. And then, for reasons of his own, the crooked lawyer entrusted with telling them the truth pretended that Hap was the rustler's son and gave to him Hewett's legacy, a six-gun with thirteen notches that had belonged to Dev Hewett, and instructions to use it to murder George Siebert, the man who had killed his father"--Provided by publisher. 0aBrothersvFiction. 0aSheriffsvFiction. 0aAdopted childrenvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128201181
