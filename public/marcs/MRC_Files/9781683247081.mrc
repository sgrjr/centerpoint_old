Knopf.  aAn extraordinarily intimate memoir of the near death experiences that have made Maggie O'Farrell the woman and the writer she is today. A childhood illness she was not expected to survive. A teenage yearning to escape that nearly ended in disaster. A terrifying encounter on a remote path. A mismanaged labour in an understaffed hospital. This is a memoir with a difference: seventeen encounters with Maggie at different ages, in different locations, reveal to us a whole life in a series of tense, visceral snapshots. It is a book to make you question yourself: what would you do if your life was in danger? How would you react? And what would you stand to lose? 10aO'Farrell, Maggie,d1972- 0aDeathvAnecdotes. 0aNovelists, Irishy20th centuryvBiography. 0aLarge type books. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1019834396
