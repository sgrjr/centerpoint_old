The new US president wants to tackle the urgent problem head-on and launches a top secret line of defense: Net Force. But before the organization can be announced, the country is hit by an unprecedented, two-pronged terror attack. Not yet empowered by Congress nor embraced by a dubious intelligence community, still untested, unproven and officially unnamed, Net Force's elite group of cyber experts and field operatives must lead the fight against the ongoing waves of hacks while tracking down the mastermind. Their failure could mean global catastrophe. Success may lead them to become the highest-level security agency in the United States"--Provided by publisher. 0aDark WebvFiction. 0aNational securityvFiction. 0aComputer securityvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aAction and adventure fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft1 aClancy, Tom,d1947-2013,ecreator.1 aPieczenik, Steve R.,ecreator.  c(OCoLC)1129460188
