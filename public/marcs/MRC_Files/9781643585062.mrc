After Wes saves Maddie Johnson - a young woman claiming to be a witch - from a vicious gang attack, the two fall in love and make a promise to leave behind their troublesome lives and start anew. Then the unthinkable happens - Wes is gunned down and murdered in cold blood. Maddie mourns her love's death, threatening that he will return to seek vengeance on the men who killed him. So when Stanley Wiggins and Rob Laverty are found dead with a piece of familiar cloth placed over their faces, citizens begin to whisper in terror - has Wes Torveen returned from the dead?"--Provided by publisher. 0aGunfightersvFiction. 0aWitchesvFiction. 0aRevengevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1128200148
