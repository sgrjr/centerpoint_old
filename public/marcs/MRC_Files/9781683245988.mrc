A festive Christmas package left on Mariah's doorstep contains an ominous present, sparking memories of a twenty-year-old murder that shattered her friendship with the victim's widow. Though the gift is a bitter reminder of that tragic time, in the spirit of the season Mariah travels to Surrey in hopes of reconciling with her estranged friend and solving the crime that drove them apart.  On arrival, Mariah joins forces with the murdered man's grandson, a sleuth in his own right who's discovered promising evidence as well as a suspect. But Surrey's picturesque hills conceal dark doings and shocking revelations that could make the holiday anything but calm and bright."--cProvided by publisher. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aWomen detectivesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aChristmas stories. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Historical.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Historical.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Traditional British.2bisacsh  c(OCoLC)1005677455
