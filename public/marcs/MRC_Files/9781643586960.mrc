Despite Scotland Yard's best efforts, the criminal remains at large and continues on his destructive path. When Joanna and the Watsons are called in to solve the mystery, they soon discover that although the canvases have been slashed, their backings remain pristine, with no cuts or scratches. The criminal, it seems, is no mere vandal-he's searching for something hidden behind the portraits. Suspicion soon falls on two skilled art restorers who previously worked at the gallery where all the vandalized art was purchased. When Joanna finds the body of one in a bricked off fireplace at the gallery, the other is left as the prime suspect. But then he's discovered dead as well. Luckily, Joanna has a plan for ensnaring the criminal once and for all. But it must not fail, or more paintings-and lives-will be lost"--Provided by publisher.10aHolmes, SherlockvFiction.10aWatson, John H.c(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aBlalock, Joanna (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aWomen private investigatorsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aFathers and daughtersvFiction. 0aWest End (London, England)vFiction. 0aLondon (England)xSocial life and customsy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft1 aGoldberg, Leonard S.tDaughter of Sherlock Holmes mystery ;v4.  c(OCoLC)1193115146  c4575d4575
