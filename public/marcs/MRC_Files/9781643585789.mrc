Apaches were constantly trying to raid the horse herd but the biggest threat was the neighboring rancher, who waited for a chance to take over the graze and the cattle. So men were hired for their gun skill and if they were good enough at this, they had time to learn the cattle trade. Such a man, and maybe a little better, was Jim Soto, the foreman of the crew. This is the story of the fight they made when the neighbor saw his chance and made his play, and of how, finally, Jim Soto was the only one left to stand against him"--Provided by publisher. 0aRanchersvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1135585022  c4473d4473
