Back in Sunset Cove, Oregon, other battles wage. Anna McDowell continues to fight old fashioned stereotypes as she runs a newspaper committed to truth. Despite opposition, she's determined to expose ongoing rum-running and prohibition lawlessness. Adding to Anna's frustrations, her good friend Dr. Daniel seems to run hot and cold. He loves Oregon, and maybe Anna too, but he's pulled by his East Coast family responsibilities. Even the lure of a new modern Sunset Cove hospital doesn't seem enough to keep him in Sunset Cove. Meanwhile, Anna's strong-willed daughter Katy continues to develop her dress shop by inviting family friend Sarah Rose to help out. But the woman's presence tests the small town's tolerance. And Anna's concern that her daughter is growing up too fast is confirmed when Katy's romantic life takes an unexpected turn, which Anna fears is influenced by the pressure of a devastating war that is not only changing the entire world but Sunset Cove as well"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aCities and townszOregonvFiction. 0aFamilieszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918zOregonvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aNineteen tensvFiction. 0aOregonxSocial life and customsy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193121469  c4581d4581
