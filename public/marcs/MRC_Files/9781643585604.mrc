S. Lewis and Lewis Carroll, and the Wayward Children series has delighted and mesmerized readers. This fourth entry tells the origin story of Lundy, a very serious young girl who would rather study and dream than become a respectable housewife and live up to the expectations of the world around her. As well she should. When she finds a doorway to a world founded on logic and reason, riddles and lies, she thinks she's found her paradise.

For anyone"--Provided by publisher. 0aChildrenxInstitutional carevFiction. 0aMagicvFiction. 0aBoarding schoolsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFantasy fiction.2lcgft1 aMcGuire, Seanan.tWayward children ;v4.  c(OCoLC)1135603131  c4455d4455
