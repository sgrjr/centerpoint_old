Gino and Frank set out to learn more about the disreputable gang and soon find a lead: a saloon-owning gangster named Nunzio Esposito. Gino hates that a fellow immigrant would stoop so low and decides to confront his wayward countryman. But he quickly discovers the man can't be reasoned with--because he's been murdered. The police have only one suspect: Gino Donatelli. Frank and Sarah know Gino is no killer, but someone has pulled out all the stops to make it look like he is guilty. They also must now face the Black Hand, who are honor-bound to avenge the death of one of their own. With evidence mounting against their friend and a group of bad guys out for blood, Sarah and Frank race to unravel a treacherous plot before Gino's time runs out"--Provided by publisher. 0aBrandt, Sarah (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aMalloy, Frank (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aPrivate investigatorszNew York (State)zNew YorkvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationzNew York (State)zNew YorkvFiction. 0aOrganized crimezNew York (State)zNew YorkvFiction. 0aGangszNew York (State)zNew YorkvFiction. 0aItalian AmericansvFiction. 0aKidnappingvFiction. 0aMissing personsvFiction. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft1 aThompson, Victoriaq(Victoria E.).tGaslight mystery ;v23.  c(OCoLC)1142716752  c4528d4528
