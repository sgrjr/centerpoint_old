He was joking of course - he joked all the time - and even if he wasn't, criticism couldn't kill a man. Moreover, the Army believed what everyone knew - that the Indians were untrained, independent, separate groups who had never worked together in a fight. But they had never had anyone to organize them. Only Monroe wondered and warned. He knew Charlie Pronghorn had the education, and the training, and the guts, to fight a mean, intelligent war. All he needed was a reason. And the whites who despised Indians couldn't wait to give him one, while the Army went on believing it could lick any dirty bunch of Injuns. So the tension grew - black and menacing as the gathering tribes in the shadow of the Bighorns"--Provided by publisher. 0aIndians of North AmericaxWarsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1193118804  c4592d4592
