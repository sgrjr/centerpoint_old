The Gold Rush is on and there is a tremendous demand for beef. Kennett has been referred to Captain Bill Ballinger, headquartered in Sacramento, as the man who can best pilot the cattle downriver. But Colonel Nathaniel Sharpe and his partner, Noah Carlin, assure Kennett that they can accomplish the job faster and cheaper than Ballinger, and they won't take no for an answer. 0aRanchersvFiction. 0aRangelandszWest (U.S.)vFiction. 0aCattle stealingvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Westerns.2bisacsh 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0974700317
