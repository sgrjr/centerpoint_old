Without their chief, the Warm Springs Apaches abandoned the murderous campaign against the blancos and the Mexicans who had invaded their tribal lands, and serenity had returned to the arid territory. But bitter memories lingered. Lieutenant Ewing Mackay was glad of the respite. During his seven-year tour of duty in Arizona Territory he had come to love the desert's austere beauty, the stark terrain where he practiced his trade of soldier. And he had come to respect and trust the Tonto Apache scouts he commanded. The years of sharing scarce water, the Army's meager rations, and the constant threat of danger had taught him to appreciate their strong qualities and their natural wisdom. He would trust his life to Archie, his Tonto scout, an honest, resourceful man, sooner than he'd turn his back on the white civilian scout, a rascal twice as treacherous as the Indians he despised. Ewing Mackay and Archie were friends. But their friendship was to be tested anew in a violent trial by fire when the Southwest erupted in a new Indian war. Mackay and his scouts were sent to stop the rampaging Apaches and bring back their leader, a man famed among the tribes for his courage, a chief, a warrior, a phantom ...
