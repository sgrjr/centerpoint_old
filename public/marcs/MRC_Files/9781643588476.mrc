The hero of dime novels, Matt won national fame during a range war in Idaho when he shot and killed an outlaw -- and former saddle pal. But the past seventeen years have been an alcoholic blur rather than a heroic journey. The West has modernized and practically disappeared when Matt arrives in Denver in 1894 as the newly appointed U.S. marshal for the state of Colorado. The cowboy-turned-lawman inherits a state on the brink of collapse. The silver crash has ruined the economy, railroaders are striking, a range war is looming, corruption is rampant, and a rumored gold strike on the Southern Ute reservation threatens to turn into a bloodbath. Slowly, Matt realizes why he got the job. His supporters figure he'll either stay too drunk to realize what's happening or take their bribes and look the other way. Instead of the hero who stopped a range war, he's usually thought of as a man who murdered his best friend in exchange for the appointment as Idaho's U.S. marshal. What no one has counted on is the fact that there's a special breed of man who will fight with his last breath to regain his dignity and self-respect. If Matt can overcome his demons and past, schoolkids might start singing a new verse to an old song"--cProvided by publisher. 0aUnited States marshalsvFiction. 0aColoradovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 0aCircle V western.  c(OCoLC)1225190678  c4738d4738
