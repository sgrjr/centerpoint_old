But Patrick, the steadfast friend who hasn't left her side, urges her to reconsider her decision. Worn down by his insistence, she reluctantly agrees to follow through with the trip they'd planned before the tragedy.During a stop at a country flea market, Jessica finds a faded document concealed in an antique. As new friends help her to translate the archaic French, they uncover the story of Adeline Baillard, a young woman who lived centuries before--her faith condemned, her life endangered, her community decimated by the Huguenot persecution. Determined to learn the Baillard family's fate, Jessica retraces their flight from France to England, spurred on by a need she doesn't understand. 0aHuguenotszFrancevFiction. 0aFrancexHistoryyLouis XIV, 1643-1715vFiction. 0aParis (France)y21st centuryvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationships. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aRomantic suspense fiction.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0990248489
