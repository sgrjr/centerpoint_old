"She's yours." Until now, Rosanna Mast's hopes for the future have all revolved around handsome Henry Zook. But when a young Englisch girl places her newborn daughter in Rosanna's arms and utters those words, shock quickly turns to fierce, protective devotion. Between helping her midwife mamm and caring for her own siblings, Rosanna has plenty of experience with babies. And who wouldn't love a sweet-natured boppli like little Mollie? Yet to her dismay, Henry has no intention of ever taking on another man's child. Instead, it is steady, thoughtful Paul Hertzler who becomes Rosanna's staunch supporter. Paul knows he should have acted sooner on his feelings for Rosanna. Now, as her dream of adopting Mollie meets unexpected hurdles, he sees a way to help. Rosanna would do anything to keep baby Mollie-perhaps even agree to marriage. But will Rosanna continue to hold him at arm's length, or see that he longs to offer her the love and family she deserves?"--Provided by publisher. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aInfantsvFiction. 0aAdoptive parentszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1135572292  c4466d4466
