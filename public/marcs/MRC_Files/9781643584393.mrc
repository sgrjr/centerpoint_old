Luckily, another Bloomer Girl, Buckskin Compton, alias Dolly Madison, is on the dodge after some shootings and beatings in Wyoming-and he takes the kid under his tutelage. Staying alive won't prove easy for either of the reluctant female impersonators as they deal with a budding romance, hitting slumps, a crooked manager, bean balls, drunken teammates, bank robbers, lousy umpires, a revolution for women's rights, and a rapidly changing Western frontier"--Provided by publisher. 0aTeenagersvFiction. 0aFemale impersonatorsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 0aCircle V western.  c(OCoLC)1112894660
