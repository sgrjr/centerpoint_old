The evidence against the powerful Saudis who coordinated the attack would be buried. In return, King Faisal would promise to keep the oil flowing and deal with the conspirators in his midst. When the king's own nephew is discovered to be funding ISIS, the U.S. president suspects that the Saudis never intended to live up to their agreement. He decides that the royalty needs to be sent a message and that Mitch Rapp is just the man to deliver it. The catch? Rapp must do it entirely on his own. America can't be seen moving against an ally. Rapp will be on his own. 0aRapp, Mitch (Fictitious character)vFiction.20aIS (Organization)vFiction. 0aIntelligence officersvFiction. 0aMalicious accusationvFiction.10aUnited States.bCentral Intelligence AgencyvFiction. 0aTerrorismxPreventionvFiction. 0aOfficial secretsvFiction. 0aSaudi ArabiaxForeign relationszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aSpy fiction.2lcgft 7aPolitical fiction.2lcgft1 aFlynn, Vince,d1966-2013,ecreator.1 aFlynn, Vince,d1966-2013.tMitch Rapp novel.  c(OCoLC)1000050240
