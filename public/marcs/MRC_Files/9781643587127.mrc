He didn't have to lift a finger - trouble just came to him as though drawn by a magnet. And when he and Applejack rode along the trail to Spanish Wells, trouble came to meet them, halfway. Four weeks earlier in Spanish Wells, rancher Jabez Drake had emerged from the town's bank carrying a small money sack that bulged on the sides when a masked man brandishing a long-barreled six-shooter had appeared. Drake had gone for his gun but was instantly shot. The bandit had scooped up the money sack, mounted and raced his pony out of town. Deputy Vaughn had fired a couple of wild shots at the escaping man then mounted his horse in pursuit. Hours later Vaughn had returned with the money sack having left the robber's body for the coyotes. But when the sack was opened, it produced nothing but packs of cut newspapers shaped to resemble packages of greenbacks. When Peaceful and Applejack ride into Spanish Wells, a month later, Jabez Drake is still recovering and nothing has been learned about the missing money. After Peaceful buys a pack of used playing cards that had belonged to the dead bandit, his troubles in Spanish Wells begin"--Provided by publisher. 0aBrigands and robbersvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193111280  c4591d4591
