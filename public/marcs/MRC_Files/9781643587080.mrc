Aunt Peg can't wait to demonstrate her judging chops on national TV, even after being hounded by frustrating mishaps - all seemingly orchestrated by Victor Durbin, an ousted Paugussett Poodle Club member with a bone to pick. But the bright lights of the show ring grow dim when Victor is found murdered, and she's the one topping the suspect list. Driven to solve the crime on her aunt's behalf, Melanie fetches hair-raising clues about the victim. Victor didn't score many friends with his unethical breeding practices, sketchy puppy cafe, and penchant for mercilessly scamming others to get ahead. He burned so many bridges that his own business partner admits to being delighted by news of his death. It appears Victor finally toyed with the wrong person, and as Melanie digs up more chilling evidence, she realizes that exonerating Aunt Peg means confronting a murderer who's in it to win it"--Provided by publisher. 0aTravis, Melanie (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aWomen private investigatorsvFiction. 0aWomen dog ownersvFiction. 0aDog showszNew York (State)vFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aConnecticutvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aCozy mysteries.2lcgft1 aBerenson, Laurien.tMelanie Travis mystery ;v25.  c(OCoLC)1193127216  c4587d4587
