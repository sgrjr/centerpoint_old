A distracted woman boards the train, takes her seat, and moments later a fiery explosion rips through the frigid air, tearing the car apart in a horrific attack on the city's transit system. One life is spared. Twenty-two are lost. A year later, Autumn Manning can't remember the day of the bombing and she is tormented by grief--by guilt. Twelve months of the question constantly echoing. Why? Why? Why? Searching for answers, she haunts the lives of the victims, unable to rest. Paul Elliott lost his wife in the train bombing and wants to let the dead rest in peace, undisturbed and unable to cause more pain for his loved ones. He wants normalcy for his twelve year-old daughter and young son, to see them move beyond the heartbreak. But when the Elliotts and Autumn are unexpectedly forced together, he fears she'll bring more wreckage in her wake.  aIncludes a conversation with Katie Ganshert. 0aSurvivalxPsychological aspectsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aGuiltvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Christian / Romance.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Romance / Contemporary.2bisacsh 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0974487715
