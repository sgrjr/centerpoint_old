But the teachers also face plenty of personal challenges and this year, they may finally spill over into the classroom. English teacher Lena Wright, a spoken-word poet, can never seem to truly connect with her students. Hernan D. Hernandez is confident in front of his biology classes, but tongue-tied around the woman he most wants to impress. Down the hall, math teacher Maybelline Galang focuses on the numbers as she struggles to parent her daughter, while Coach Ray hustles his troubled football team toward another winning season. Recording it all is idealistic second-year history teacher Kaytee Mahoney, whose anonymous blog gains new readers by the day as it drifts ever further from her in-class reality. And this year, a new superintendent is determined to leave his own mark on the school -- even if that means shutting the whole place down."--cProvided by publisher. 0aBloggersvFiction. 0aTeachersvFiction. 0aHigh schoolsvFiction. 0aTeacher-student relationshipsvFiction. 0aSatire. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193119174  c4629d4629
