But Valère's ideas of a peaceful retirement are quickly dashed. Rambunctious neighborhood children, a fast-talking gossip of a housekeeper, and a rival novelist filter through the home at all hours of the day -- and by night there are unseen visitors with more sinister intentions. While Antoine Verlaque investigates Valère's sordid history, his wife and partner, Marine Bonnet, questions why the estate was abandoned in the first place -- and what they both find raises more questions than answers. Is Valère imagining the ethereal cries that fill the bastide at night? Is he losing his mind? Or have these ghosts returned from Valère's checkered past to haunt him?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aJudgeszFrancevFiction. 0aWomen law teachersvFiction. 0aAuthorsxCrimes againstvFiction. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1198976496  c4644d4644
