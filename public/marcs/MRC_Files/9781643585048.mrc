Her beloved fiancâe, Gideon Bates, is awaiting his turn in the draft to fight in the Great War. Elizabeth is finding it hard to think of anything else, but Gideon has thrown himself into his work, preparing wills for soldiers before they ship out. Corporal Tom Preston is part owner of Preston Shoes, a company that is making footwear for the army, so he has a rather large estate. He needs a new will, however, because he has just been secretly married to a woman whom his family would never approve. He wants to make sure she and their unborn child are provided for if he does not return. When Tom is later reported killed, Elizabeth and Gideon learn that the new will has gone missing after Tom's bride revealed her identity to his family. Unless the new will is found and validated, the original will, which leaves everything to Tom's brother, will prevail and the wife and child will get nothing. If Tom's new bride survives, that is. Some terrible threats have been leveled against her, and Elizabeth and Gideon must figure out a way, legal or not quite, to secure Tom's fortune for his wife and child while saving her life in the process"--Provided by publisher. 0aSwindlers and swindlingvFiction. 0aWillsvFiction. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aInfluenza Epidemic, 1918-1919vFiction. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918vFiction. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomantic suspense fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aThompson, Victoriaq(Victoria E.).tCounterfeit lady novel ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1128194676
