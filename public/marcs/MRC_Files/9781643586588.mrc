In 1937, there are recesses in Appalachia no outsiders have ever explored. Two government-sponsored documentarians from Cincinnati, Ohio-a writer and photographer-are dispatched to penetrate this wilderness and record what they find for President Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration. For photographer Clay Havens, the assignment is his last chance to reboot his flagging career. So when he and his journalist partner are warned away from the remote Spooklight Holler outside of town, they set off eagerly in search of a headline story. What they see will haunt Clay into his old age: Jubilee Buford, a woman whose skin is a shocking and unmistakable shade of blue. From this happenstance meeting between a woman isolated from society and persecuted her whole life, and a man accustomed to keeping himself at lens distance from others, comes a mesmerizing story in which the dark shades of betrayal, prejudice, fear, and guilt, are refracted along with the incandescent hues of passion and courage"--Provided by publisher. 0aPhotographersvFiction. 0aJournalistsvFiction. 0aPersecutionvFiction. 0aPrejudicesvFiction. 0aBetrayalvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aKentuckyvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aSocial problem fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179253257  c4541d4541
