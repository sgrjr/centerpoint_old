But when she meets Jake Kristopher during their first week at Yale they instantly feel a deep connection, as if they've known each other before. They quickly become a couple, and as college goes on, Sophie distances herself from academia as Jake intensely pursues a finance career. But when a shocking change forces Sophie into a new reality, she returns to physics and seeks to prove Block Theory, which considers space-time as an unchanging four-dimensional block in which past, present, and future occur simultaneously. Inspired by her connection with Jake, Sophie throws herself headfirst into her studies, determined to prove that those she loves belong together in all realities. Spanning decades, The Love Proof is an unusual and refreshing love story about connection, time, and intuition, urging us to listen to our hearts rather than our heads"--cProvided by publisher. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aWomen physicistsvFiction. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aScience fiction.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225192368  c4734d4734
