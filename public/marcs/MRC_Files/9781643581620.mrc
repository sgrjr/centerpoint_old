His human, Jamie Snyder, has found the perfect packmate-and it's all thanks to Mac. By stealing personal items from the home of Jamie's handsome neighbor David, the matchmaking cat brought these two L.A. singles together. Now, while the newlyweds are off on their honeymoon, MacGyver is ready for a well-deserved cat nap. That is, until he meets his cat sitter Briony. Like most humans, she's hopeless when it comes to romance. And Mac can't resist a challenge... Briony feels terrible about leaving her fiance´ at the altar. When her cousin Jamie offers her the chance to cat sit MacGyver, the runaway bride leaps at the chance to cuddle up with the only male creature she trusts herself around. But MacGyver has other plans. He lures Briony to a friendly neighborhood retirement community run by a charming young hottie named Nate. Briony and Nate hit it off instantly. But Briony's still not sure she's ready for a relationship. And Nate's got problems of his own--someone is sabotaging his community. Crazy humans. Why can't they follow their instincts and go after the love they deserve? MacGyver is on the case. And this time, he's not pussyfooting around. 0aCatsvFiction. 0aTabby catsvFiction. 0aCat ownersvFiction. 0aSingle peoplevFiction. 0aDating (Social customs)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aNovels.2lcgft 7aHumorous fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aAnimal fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1080546368
