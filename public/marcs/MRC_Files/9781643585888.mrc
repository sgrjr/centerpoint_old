When Sara Farrow checks on the children at midnight, her son is missing. Distrustful of the police, Sara turns to Crimson Lake's unlikeliest private investigators--disgraced cop Ted Conkaffey and convicted killer Amanda Pharrell. For Ted, the case couldn't have come at a worse time. Two years ago a false accusation robbed him of his career, his reputation, and most importantly, his family. But now Lillian, the daughter he barely knows, is coming to stay in his ramshackle cottage by the lake. Ted must dredge up the area's worst characters to find the missing boy. The clock is ticking, and the danger he uncovers could well put his own child in deadly peril"--Provided by publisher. 0aMissing childrenvFiction. 0aMissing personsxInvestigationvFiction. 0aParent and childvFiction. 0aHotelszAustraliavFiction. 0aCairns (Qld.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aFox, Candice.tCrimson Lake novel ;vbk. 3.  c(OCoLC)1137839142  c4479d4479
