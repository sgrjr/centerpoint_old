As she takes in the magnificent energy and brassy sounds of her youth, the past comes to life, along with the fateful decision all those years ago that forced her to choose between personal conviction and social expectation, between the two men who had captured her heart. It had been a time of great music and love, but also of war and sacrifice, and now, trying to make peace with her memories, Lorraine must find the courage to face buried secrets. In the process, she will rediscover herself, her passion, and her capacity for resilience. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aBallroom dancingvFiction. 0aReminiscingvFiction. 0aBallroomsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Historical.2bisacsh 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0974700283
