As a widow with a young son who is deaf, lip reading is simply second nature, until the day she reads the lips of someone on the phone discussing an attempt to be made on a senator's life--a senator who just happens to be her mother-in-law. Before she can decide what she needs to do, she receives the information that her son is rushed to the ER and she must leave. Then she later sees the news report that her mother-in-law has been shot and killed. But when she comes forward, her life, as well as her son's life, may now be in the crosshairs of the assassin"--Provided by publisher. 0aInterpreters for the deafvFiction. 0aLipreadingvFiction. 0aAssassinationvFiction. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aLegislatorszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aArkansasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193125514  c4582d4582
