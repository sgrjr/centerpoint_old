He cannot understand the enmity of Dale Cummings, the town's leading merchant who seems eager to dispose of him. In his favor, Channing has the support of the town's sheriff and judge over whom he holds political power, a group of unsavory gambling den hirelings and a sinister Mexican servant. Ken's small group of supporters is hardly a match for this murderous crew and, when help from outside finally does arrive, it immediately falls into Channing's hands"--Provided by publisher. 0aMerchantsvFiction. 0aColoradovFiction.  0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179256109  c4562d4562
