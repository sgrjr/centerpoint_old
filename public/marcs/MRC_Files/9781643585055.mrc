With Easter around the corner, Bailey's been recruited to create a giant toffee bunny for the weeklong springtime festival that will also feature live white rabbits. But back home in Harvest, death becomes the main attraction when Stephen Raber keels over from an apparent heart attack-with Bailey and Raber's pet bunny as witnesses. Except it wasn't Raber's heart that suddenly gave out-a lethal dose of lily of the valley was mixed into a tasty piece of toffee. Who'd want to poison a jovial rabbit farmer who reminded Bailey of an Amish Santa Claus? To solve the murder, she and her sheriff deputy boyfriend Aiden must uncover a twenty-year-old secret. She'll need to pull a rabbit out of a hat to keep a healthy distance from toxic people, including one venomous killer"--Provided by publisher.10aKing, Baileyc(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aConfectioneryvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aRabbitsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 0aEaster stories.1 aFlower, Amanda.tAmish candy shop mystery ;v4.  c(OCoLC)1128200156
