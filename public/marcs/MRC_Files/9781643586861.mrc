Elle Sheen--a single mother who is supporting herself and her six-year-old, African-American son, Dylan, as a waitress at the Noel Street Diner--isn't sure what to make of William Smith when his appearance creates a stir in the small town of Mistletoe, Utah. As their lives unexpectedly entwine, Elle learns that William, a recently returned Vietnam POW, is not only fighting demons from his past, but may also have the answer to her own secret pain--a revelation that culminates in a remarkable act of love and forgiveness"--Provided by publisher. 0aWaitressesvFiction. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aVietnam War, 1961-1975xVeteranszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aForgivenessvFiction. 0aUtahvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aChristmas fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft1 aEvans, Richard Paul.tNoel collection ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1193119353  c4565d4565
