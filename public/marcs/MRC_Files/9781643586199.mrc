Too smart for his anchor job on the nightly news. And too enamored with the heady addictions of the high life. That man died in a tragic accident with his fianc√©e. With grief and guilt battling for control, Daniel moved to the quiet California seaside town of Miramar Bay with his best friend-a rescue Labradoodle who still sees him through rough times. Daniel's a different man now. Clean, sober, and taking things one day at a time with no commitments to anyone except himself. And just as his solitude begins to chafe, two souls in need of fresh starts unexpectedly enter Daniel's life"--Provided by publisher. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aForgivenessvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aCaliforniavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142511464  c4506d4506
