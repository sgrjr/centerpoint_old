But a fresh clue leads San Antonio police detective Amara Alvarez to the unlikely conclusion that one of the children may still be alive. If she's correct, everything law enforcement believes about the accident is a lie. With time running out, Amara must convince others--and herself--that despite all evidence to the contrary, the boy lives. And she will do everything in her power to bring him home"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen detectivesvFiction. 0aSchool bus accidentsvFiction. 0aCriminal investigationvFiction. 0aSan Antonio (Tex.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aMyster fiction.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1129459265
