But when her beloved husband dies, she is so devastated she can barely get out of bed. To make matters worse, her son, Zach, has abruptly quit his job in Silicon Valley and been out of contact for seven months. Maxine is jolted from her grief by her sudden suspicion that a favorite former student (and a former close friend of her son) might be a terrorist called the Technobomber and that Zach might either be involved in or become a victim of this extremist's bombing. Deserting her teaching responsibilities, her ailing mother, and an appealing suitor, Maxine feels compelled to set out and search for her son in order to warn and protect him, even as she knows she should report her suspicions to the FBI to prevent greater carnage"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen college teacherszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aGriefvFiction. 0aMothers and sonsvFiction. 0aTerrorismxPreventionvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129459418
