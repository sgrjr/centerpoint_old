Here is Olive, strangely content in her second marriage, still in an evolving relationship with her son and his family, encountering a cast of memorable characters in the seaside town of Crosby, Maine. Whether it's a young girl coming to terms with the loss of her father, a young woman about to give birth at a baby shower, or a nurse who confesses a secret high school crush, the irascible Olive improbably touches the lives of others"--Provided by publisher. 0aRetired teachersvFiction. 0aCity and town lifevFiction. 0aMainevFiction. 0aLarge type books.1 iPreceded by (work):aStrout, Elizabeth.tOlive Kitteridge.  c(OCoLC)1112896343
