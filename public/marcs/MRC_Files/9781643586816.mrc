But, as Tom was to discover, it's easier to fight an enemy than to fight a friend. Tom knew that Van Winston, the crooked rancher who owned the Circle W, was determined to take over the Double Y and add it to his holdings. What he didn't know was that his own closest friend, Bill Corey, was a member of a gang of rustlers whose raids were slowly destroying the Double Y. Then one of Tom's punchers was murdered and a herd of prize Herefords stolen - and the decisive moment came. The fate of the Double Y hung by the slim strength of one man as Tom Frazer's enemies learned - in a battle of conflicting loyalties and flaming six-guns - that it's safer not to tangle with a fighting ramrod"--Provided by publisher. 0aRanchersvFiction. 0aCattle stealingvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179290736  c4564d4564
