He has been summarily fired from every job he has ever had and even comes to regard himself as a failure. He makes one more try when he is hired on as a blacksmith's assistant by Boston Charlie. Finally here is a job that Tom can perform successfully, and his spirit soars. Oliver Champion, who stops at the smithy to have his wagon horses newly shod, is impressed by Tom's ability. Champion also recognizes Tom Fuller as the son of the late Washington Fuller, a renowned gunfighter. Boston Charlie, far from being impressed by this revelation, is outraged and fires Tom, insisting that he leave at once. Champion follows Tom Fuller and proposes that Tom, who in addition to his physical strength is also an excellent shot, should become his bodyguard. Tom soon learns that Champion is new to the West, that he is an escaped convict from a prison in the East, and that he has come as far as he has because he is in pursuit of a master criminal, Henry Plank, the man actually responsible for the robbery for which Champion was sentenced to prison"--Provided by publisher. 0aBodyguardsvFiction. 0aEscaped prisonersvFiction. 0aTracking and trailingvFiction. 0aRevengevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1122799110
