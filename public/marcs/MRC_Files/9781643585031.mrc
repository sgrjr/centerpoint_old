Sarah is sure she's in for the experience of a lifetime-days spent surrounded by literature in a gorgeous bookshop, and the chance to watch the snow fall on the Eiffel Tower. Plus, now she can meet up with her journalist boyfriend, Ridge, when his job takes him around the globe. But her expectations cool faster than her cafâe au lait soon after she lands in the City of Light-she's a fish out of water in Paris. The customers are rude, her new coworkers suspicious and her relationship with Ridge has been reduced to a long-distance game of phone tag, leaving Sarah to wonder if he'll ever put her first over his busy career. As Christmas approaches, Sarah is determined to get the shop-and her life-back in order ... and make her dreams of a Parisian happily-ever-after come true"--Provided by publisher. 0aBookstoresvFiction. 0aHolidaysvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aParis (France)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aChristmas fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128199244
