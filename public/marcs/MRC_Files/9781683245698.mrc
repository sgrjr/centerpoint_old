Before they can identify the killer, Tracy and her colleagues on the Seattle PD's Violent Crimes Section must figure out who the victim is. Her autopsy, however, reveals she may have gone to great lengths to conceal her identity. So who was she running from? After evidence surfaces that their Jane Doe may be a woman who suspiciously disappeared months earlier, Tracy is once again haunted by the memory of her sister's unsolved murder. Dredging up details from the woman's past leads to conflicting clues that only seem to muddy the investigation. As Tracy begins to uncover a twisted tale of brutal betrayal and desperate greed, she'll find herself risking everything to confront a killer who won't go down without a deadly fight."--cAmazon.com. 0aWomen detectivesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aMissing personsvFiction. 0aPuget Sound (Wash.)vFiction. 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Police Procedural.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Women Sleuths.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Thrillers / Crime.2bisacsh 0aLarge type books. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aDugoni, Robert.tTracy Crosswhite series ;v4.  c(OCoLC)1000050537
