This small-time cattle rustler is expanding his brand by brewing batches of whiskey in the Chocktaw territory of Muddy Boggy Creek. Tiny and his partner have also turned the illegal brewery into a robber's roost for outlaws, cutthroats, and killers of every bent. Local lawman Jim Little Eagle is under attack and out-gunned. But when he sends a wire to Fort Smith asking for backup-and the U.S. Deputy Marshal Tanner shows up, Little Eagle knows they're in for one hell of a bloodbath. If anyone can drive those murdering devils to their knees and saying their prayers, it's Will Tanner"--Provided by publisher. 0aUnited States marshalsvFiction. 0aCattle stealingvFiction. 0aBrigands and robbersvFiction. 0aBrewingvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft1 aJohnstone, J.
