The facials, organics, food, and fitness coaches are supposed to be phenomenal, but Tinkie's primary aim is to attend the Sunrise Easter Services at the incredible Palestinian Gardens, a miniature Holy Land that spreads over 20 acres and has recreations of all parts of Jerusalem-and to speak with the Biblical scholar, gardener, and creator of the Palestinian Garden Daniel Reynolds. After waking up at the crack of dawn for the service the three friends wander around the gardens, taking in the wonder of entire cities in miniature and the acres of the Holy Land, with the River Jordan winding through it all. The day is brightening when the find themselves at the Mount of Olives-with a dead body. Daniel identifies the dead man as local lawyer Perry Slay, who was well known for his sly and underhanded dealings, and had plenty of people out for his blood. When Erick Ward, a local pharmacist, is arrested, Sarah Booth takes the case. As the bodies pile up like a pillar of salt and the suspect list grows as long as the River Jordan, Sarah Booth, Cece, and Tinkie must resurrect the truth before their own lives-and that of Tinkie's unborn child-are endangered"--cProvided by publisher. 0aDelaney, Sarah Booth (Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aWomen private investigatorszMississippivFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.1 aHaines, Carolyn.tSarah Booth Delaney mystery.0no20091199570http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2009119957  c(OCoLC)1225192828  c4736d4736
