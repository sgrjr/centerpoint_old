Their jailmates are army deserters. Even worse, their jailers assume Ace and Chance are deserters, too. Which earns them even more hard time-on a brutal prison chain gang . Things go from bad to worse awfully fast. One prisoner tries to escape and gets blasted in the back. Others face horrific torture at the hands of sadistic renegades. And the whole operation is run by a maniacal army major who's working the deserters to death for his own profit. Ace and Chance have no choice but to bust out of this miserable hellhole-or die trying"--Provided by publisher. 0aPrisonersvFiction. 0aEscapesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd1 aJohnstone, J.
