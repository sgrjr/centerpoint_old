With a unique breadth of insight, Lady Colin Campbell goes behind the scenes, speaking to friends, relations, courtiers, and colleagues on both sides of the Atlantic to reveal the most unexpected royal story since King Edward VIII's abdication. She highlights the dilemmas involved and the issues that lurk beneath the surface, revealing why the couple decided to step down as senior royals. She analyses the implications of the actions of a young and ambitious Duke and Duchess of Sussex, in love with each other and with the empowering lure of fame and fortune, and leads the reader through the maze of contradictions Meghan and Harry have created--while also evoking the Californian culture that has influenced the couple's conduct. Meghan and Harry: The Real Story exposes how the royal couple tried and failed to change the royal system--by adapting it to their own needs and ambitions--and, upon failing, how they decided to create a new system--and life--for themselves." -- amazon.com.00aMeghan,cDuchess of Sussex,d1981-00aHarry,cPrince, Duke of Sussex,d1984- 0aRoyal coupleszGreat BritainvBiography. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201656696  c4661d4661
