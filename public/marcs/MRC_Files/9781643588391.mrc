It's the booming California Gold Rush of 1849, and the toughest man in town is ready to face his truth. Truitt Emerson wants out. Enough fighting and terrorizing gold miners, he wants to leave Hangtown for good. But now, stranded with two young women from back East who his boss expects delivered to Hangtown, things just got worse. He'd like nothing more than to leave the thin, red-headed woman to the Indians, but the other, a beauty clutching a silly case, has him looking back to watch her every move. As soon as she literally fell into his arms, he had to know, was this one his boss's intended bride? Cassidy O'Ryan was pulled from her Irish grandparents'home as a child, and now her father tries to manage her life. Unwilling to marry to please her father in a convenient business alliance, she promised him she'd travel to Hangtown, a new gold-rush town, to wed her cousin, solidifying the family business in the West. All goes well until Truitt burns her beloved violin. Will the toughest man in Hangtown break under the truth?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aCaliforniaxGold discoveriesvFiction. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225192730  c4729d4729
