Trapped in a tangle of postpartum depression and grief after the death of her beloved parents, she couldn't quite see the way back to her husband and their two beautiful kids--until a car accident stole away her memories and changed her life. And when she finally remembered the sound of little Cassie's laugh, the baby powder smell of Bridger, and the feel of her husband's hand in hers, Elizabeth worried that they'd moved on without her. That she'd missed too much. That perhaps she wasn't the right mother for her kids or wife for Luke, no matter how much she loved them"--Provided by publisher. 0aMarried peoplevFiction. 0aMemory disordersvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aReconciliationvFiction. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aIdahovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aChristmas fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft1 aThayne, RaeAnne.tHaven Point.  c(OCoLC)1179287544  c4555d4555
