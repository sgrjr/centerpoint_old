Ever since the fateful day that leveled her world, Charlotte has worked hard to move forward. Great job at a hot social media analytics company? Check. Roommate with no knowledge of her past? Check. Adorable dog? Check. All the while, she's faithfully data-crunched her way through life, calculating the probability of risk-so she can avoid it. Yet Charlotte's algorithms could never have predicted that her late husband's ashes would land squarely on her doorstep five years later. Stunned but determined, Charlotte sets out to find meaning in this sudden twist of fate, even if that includes facing her perfectly coiffed, and perfectly difficult, ex-mother-in-law-and her husband's best friend, who seems to become a fixture at her side whether she likes it or not. But soon a shocking secret surfaces, forcing Charlotte to answer questions she never knew to ask and to consider the possibility of forgiveness. And when a chance at new love arises, she'll have to decide once and for all whether to follow the numbers or trust her heart"--Provided by publisher. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aForgivenessvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128199374
