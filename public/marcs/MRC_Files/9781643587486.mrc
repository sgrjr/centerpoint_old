Sixteen years earlier, his father had planned to help hundreds of families settle in the valley. Not wanting to lose their spread, local ranchers had murdered Morgan's brothers and driven his family away. Now Morgan owned half the valley, but he'd had to borrow money from ruthless bankers to buy the land. With the ranchers gunning to stop him from selling his acres to new settlers, and the bankers waiting to foreclose if he didn't, Morgan's back was pinned to the wall. But he'd shot his way out of tight spots before, and he was more than willing to cut down anyone who stood in the way of making his father's dream come true."--cProvided by publisher. 0aCowboysvFiction. 0aRevengevFiction. 0aOregonvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193112151  c4649d4649
