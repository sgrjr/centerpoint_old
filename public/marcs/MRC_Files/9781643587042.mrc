Arriving home on the Big Island too late to reconcile with her estranged father, she is left alone to untangle the clues of his legacy, which lead to a secret property tucked away in the remote rain forest of Kilauea volcano. When the government starts taking away neighbors as suspected sympathizers, Lana shelters two young German girls, a Japanese fisherman and his son. As tensions escalate, they are forced into hiding - only to discover the hideaway house is not what they expected. When a detainment camp is established nearby, Lana struggles to keep the secrets of those in her care. Trust could have dangerous consequences. As their lives weave together, Lana begins to understand the true meaning of family and how the bonds of love carry us through the worst times"--Provided by publisher. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945zHawaiivFiction. 0aFathersxDeathvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aGermanszHawaiivFiction. 0aJapanese fictionzHawaii. 0aHiding placeszHawaiivFiction. 0aConcentration campszHawaiivFiction. 0aKilauea Volcano (Hawaii)vFiction. 0aHawaiixHistoryy1900-1959vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aWar fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193125754  c4583d4583
