She's ready to celebrate the year for herself, and MacGyver, of course. MacGyver is an adorable tabby with a not-so-adorable habit of sneaking out at night and stealing things from the neighbors. He's still the only male Jamie trusts-and the only companion she needs. But MacGyver knows his human is lonely. He can smell it. It's the same smell he's noticed on their neighbor David, a handsome young baker who's tired of his friends trying to fix him up. But now MacGyver's on the case. 0aSingle womenvFiction. 0aTabby catsvFiction. 0aHuman-animal relationshipsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aCourtshipvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1019844665
