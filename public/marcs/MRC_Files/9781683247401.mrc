But one November day, moments after dismissing her class, a girl's face appears above the students' desks and terror rushes through Nora's body. Twenty-four hours later, while on Thanksgiving vacation, the face appears again. Shaken and unsteady, Nora meets with neurologists and eventually, a psychiatrist. As the story progresses, a terrible secret is discovered--a secret that pushes Nora toward an even deeper psychological breakdown. 0aHigh school teachersvFiction. 0aNeurastheniavFiction. 0aApparitionsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1021060268
