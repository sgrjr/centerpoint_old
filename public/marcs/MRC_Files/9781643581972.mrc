Despite the Great Depression, unpredictable weather, and unforgiving landscape, she and her new husband Jerry stay on even after their Amish friends and family move back east. When a plague of grasshoppers destroys every last morsel of vegetation after yet another drought, Hannah and Jerry return to the fertile soil of Pennsylvania, where life will be safe and predictable. When tragedy strikes again, leaving Hannah widowed, she begins to grapple with her faith. What will it take for her to feel like she's home, like she finally belongs somewhere? 0aAmishvFiction. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aChristian lifevFiction. 0aFarm lifezPennsylvaniavFiction. 0aNorth DakotavFiction. 0aPennsylvaniavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft1 aByler, Linda.tDakota series ;vbk. 3.  c(OCoLC)1085203758
