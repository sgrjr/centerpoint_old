With Christmas around the corner, their only wish is for new foster parents as nice as Mr. and Mrs. Kurtz. Meanwhile, the Kurtzes have wishes of their own-and with faith, they all may be gifted with twice the blessings.  3New beginningsaStill grieving the loss of her husband and unborn baby in an accident several months ago, Elizabeth Yoder is oblivious to her neighbor Luke Bontrager's deepening affection for her. But while she bleakly faces Christmas alone, it's Luke who reminds her it's the season for giving. And when Elizabeth donates her handmade baby clothes to New Beginnings, a home for teen moms, she soon finds her gifts repaid beyond measure, with Luke's love-and new beginnings of their own.  3Twins times twoaSpirited twins Priscilla and Leora Schwietert have each been blessed with mischievous twins of their own-all born on Christmas. Nearing their fourteenth birthdays, their sons have asked for horses. Their parents can fulfill their wish-but worry they'll be rewarding unruly behavior. The solution: A contract requiring hard work and an anonymous gift for someone in need. After thoughtful prayer, the boys surprise their parents-as each husband and wife rediscovers their joy in Christmas and their love for each other.00tChristmas not-wish /rShelley Shepard Gray --tNew beginnings /rRachel J.
