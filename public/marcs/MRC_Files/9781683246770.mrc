Ari Thâor Arason: a rookie policeman on his first posting, far from his girlfriend in Reykjavik--with a past that he's unable to leave behind. When a young woman is found lying half-naked in the snow, bleeding and unconscious, and a highly esteemed, elderly writer falls to his death in the local theater, Ari is dragged straight into the heart of a community where he can trust no one, and secrets and lies are a way of life. Past plays tag with the present and the claustrophobic tension mounts, while Ari is thrust ever deeper into his own darkness -- blinded by snow, and with a killer on the loose. Taut and terrifying, Snowblind is a startling debut from an extraordinary new talent."--cProvided by publisher.  aTranslated from the Icelandic. 0aPolicezIcelandvFiction. 0aViolent crimeszIcelandvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 1aIcelandvFiction. 7aFICTIONxMystery & DetectivexPolice Procedural.2bisacsh 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1009072900
