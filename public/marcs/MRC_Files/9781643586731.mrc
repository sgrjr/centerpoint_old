Tom has spent years helping the downtrodden in London while lying to everyone he meets, but now he's forced to slow down and confront his unexamined life. Miranda, a skilled artist, is haunted by her painful past and unable to imagine a future. Tom is a welcome distraction from her troubles, but she's determined to relegate him to her fantasy world, sensing that any real relationship with him would be more trouble than it's worth. Besides, she has sworn to remain devoted to someone she's left behind. When Tom returns to London, his life begins to unravel as he faces the consequences of both his affair with a married woman and his abusive childhood. When his secrets catch up with him and his reputation is destroyed, he realizes that Miranda is the only person he trusts with the truth. What he doesn't realize is that even if she believes him and returns his feelings, he can't free her from the shackles of her past."--Provided by publisher. 0aClergyzEnglandvFiction. 0aBrothers and sistersvFiction. 0aWomen artistszEnglandvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aScandalsvFiction. 0aNineteen hundreds (Decade)vFiction. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179262803  c4556d4556
