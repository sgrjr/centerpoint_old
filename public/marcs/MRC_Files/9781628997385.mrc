Penniless and exhausted in body and spirit, fleeing from a revenge-crazed rancher whose brother he had shot in self-defense, Sam had reached the end of his rope and returned to Cottonwood Grove to die. He was never really certain what had brought him back--chance or design--but he was back now at the only place he had ever called home, and there he would stay. To the citizens of the sleepy cattle-town in Western Kansas, however, Sam's return was an event that shook them to their very roots. There were many who remembered the Sam Court of six years earlier, a young sheriff who had saved the town's hide many times. But there were also many newcomers in town, and those with short memories who knew him only by his recent reputation as a gunfighter. And as Sam prepared for his final showdown with the man who would kill him, the town split right down the middle between those who wanted to stand by him and those who wanted to throw him to the wolves! 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd
