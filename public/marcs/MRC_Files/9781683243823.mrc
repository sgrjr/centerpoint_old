L. Longworth's acclaimed Verlaque & Bonnet Provenc¸al Mystery series, the newlywed investigators contend with their most sinister challenge yet: a centuries-old curse... Chef Bear Valets has just opened his own restaurant, La Fontaine, in Aix-en-Provence. It's an immediate success--great reviews and a loyal clientele, including Verlaque and Bonnet. But when he decides to extend his restaurant's seating into an historic courtyard, some very powerful neighbors are against him. The historical society wants the courtyard, which had witnessed the 16th century hanging of an innocent man, and the murder of two resistant fighters in 1943 by the Gestapo, to remain untouched. Valets charges on, but has to temporarily close the restaurant when a skeleton is unearthed in the garden, buried in shallow ground next to an ancient stone fountain. La Fontaine reopens, only for more bad luck to hit. But when Valets begins receiving threatening letters, he becomes convinced that his life is in danger. And then the fountain, for only the third time in 352 years, stops running. By disturbing the garden, has Bear triggered the curse of la fontaine? And can newlyweds Verlaque and Bonnet solve the mystery before someone else ends up dead?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aPrivate investigatorsvFiction. 0aMarried peoplevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Traditional British.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Mystery & Detective / Women Sleuths.2bisacsh 7aParanormal fiction.2lcgft 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd1 aLongworth, M.
