Surprisingly, Catrina finds contentment and peace in this promising new land, though she won't risk telling anyone about her past. But the unexpected sparks between her and bashful warm-hearted farmer Eli Webber suddenly have her dreaming of an impossible chance at happiness-as his wife. Eli never imagined such a spirited woman would look his way. Or that he could ever deserve her, given his own guilty mistakes. But Catrina's vivacity and kindness have him impulsively proposing. Unfortunately, his over-righteous sister, and the consequences of secrets on both sides, threaten to tear their marriage apart for good. Now Catrina and Eli must try forgiving themselves and finding strength in their bond if they are to have a joyous future together"--Provided by publisher. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifevFiction. 0aOrphansvFiction. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aPennsylvaniaxHistoryy18th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128196379
