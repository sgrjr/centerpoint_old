And by night, she goes on bad dates with misbehaving dudes she's matched with on the ubiquitous dating app, Fluttr. But after one too many, Mel has had it. Using her brilliant coding skills, she designs an app of her own, one that allows users to log harrassers and abusers in online dating space. It's called JerkAlert, and it goes viral overnight. Mel is suddenly in way over her head. Worse still, her almost-boyfriend, the dreamy Alex Hernandez has no idea she's the brains behind the app. Soon, Mel is faced with a terrible choice: one that could destroy her career, love life, and friendships, or change her life forever"--Provided by publisher. 0aSingle womenvFiction. 0aComputer programmingvFiction. 0aOnline datingvFiction. 0aApplication softwarevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122801938
