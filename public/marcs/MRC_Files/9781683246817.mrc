Rumor has it Johnny can seduce anything in a skirt quicker than he can hail a cab. But now, the notorious womanizer claims he's born again. Eliza soon finds herself falling for the humble, grace-filled man John has become--a man who shows no sign of returning her feelings. No sign, that is, until she discovers something John never meant for her to see."--cProvided by publisher. 0aActors and actressesvFiction. 0aBiographersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aChristian fiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1009056917
