Two generations before Corinne Foxworth locked her children in an attic, the life of her grandmother, a gorgeous young girl named Corrine Dixon changed forever. At age sixteen, she discovered she was pregnant by the wealthy and handsome Garland Foxworth. Now, trapped in the labyrinthine Foxworth estate, young Corrine is overwhelmed with her stifled life and domineering husband. When an artist is hired to paint her portrait, she immediately falls in love and is convinced to abandon this dark world forever, unaware that her decision could have far-reaching consequences that linger for generations"--Provided by publisher. 0aDysfunctional familiesvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aTeenage pregnancyvFiction. 0aRunaway wivesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aSuspense fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft1 aAndrews, V.
