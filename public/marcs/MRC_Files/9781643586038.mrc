Trent July has been the mayor of this historic town for the past four years, but now he's ready to let someone else take up the mantle. Barrett Payne, a former Marine, decides he wants the job. But when a surprise candidate also enters the ring, the town has opinions on who would be the best candidate. And of course that's not the only drama, as Malachi "Mal" July continues to make reparations for the damage he's caused and to the people he's betrayed, especially his lady love Bernadine. Is she finally ready to forgive him and let the past go? As the residents of Henry Adams have learned, life will throw obstacles their way, but it's how they come together and rise above these challenges that keep the bonds of their close-knit community strong"--Provided by publisher. 0aMayorsvFiction. 0aPolitical candidatesxWomenvFiction. 0aSmall citiesvFiction. 0aCity and town lifevFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft1 aJenkins, Beverly,d1951-tBlessings novel.  c(OCoLC)1137813406  c4494d4494
