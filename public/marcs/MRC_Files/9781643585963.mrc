The high-powered job, expensive condo, and designer wardrobe are all part of her plan to prove to her family that her life choices haven't been in vain. But when she's asked to cover up a client's misdeeds with serious moral and legal ramifications, she can no longer sacrifice her conscience for her career ... and the cost is no less than her job. Ever since a devastating climbing accident in Central America eight months ago, and a bad decision that dried up his sponsorships, professional rock climber Bryan Shaw has found himself at similar loose ends. When the opportunity to buy a coffee farm in Colombia arises, he jumps on it--only to discover his wandering ways have left him utterly unprepared to run a business. When Bryan returns home and offers Ana a role in his company as a solution to both their problems, she's desperate enough to consider working with the far-too-flippant and far-too-handsome climber, even though he's the polar opposite of her type A nature. As they delve deeper into the business, however, she begins to suspect there's much more to Bryan than she's given him credit for ... and that sometimes the best plans are the ones you never see coming"--Provided by publisher. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aCrisis managementxEmployeesvFiction. 0aMountaineersvFiction. 0aCoffee plantationsvFiction. 0aBusinesswomenvFiction. 0aDenver (Colo.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft1 aLaureano, Carla.tSupper Club novel ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1137810069  c4487d4487
