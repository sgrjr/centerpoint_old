Leaving death and devastation behind them, they raid town after town, slaughtering, looting, and burning. Dressed in white robes that conceal their identity and seemingly unharmed by bullets, the Ghost Riders may not even be human! Facing the greatest challenge of his career, legendary Texas Ranger Jim Blawcyzk sets out on the trail of the Ghost Riders, accompanied by his partners Smoky McCue and Jim Huggins. Blawcyzk is confident that no owlhoot is immune to Ranger lead. What he doesn't know, however, is that before this case is over, the deadly threat of the Ghost Riders will reach out and touch his own family"--Provided by publisher.20aTexas RangersvFiction. 0aOutlawszTexasvFiction. 0aTexasxHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129458901
