Through his own inner drive and force of character, and equipped with a far better education than the usual reservation Indian, Charlie determines to escape from the prison of his color. He has always dreamed of being a farmer in the community where he grew up. He enlists in the Army, saves several thousand dollars from his pay as sergeant, and buys a good tract of neglected land. From the moment of his acquiring the farm, tension begins to mount as Charlie experiences the torments of white bigotry. Charlie begins to see he is developing some of these same attitudes as he tries to distance himself from the negative characteristics of his people by living like the white man. Charlie must come to accept who he is as a person before he can step into the leadership role only he can fill - one that will bring change to his community"--Provided by publisher. 0aIndians of North AmericavFiction. 0aFarmersvFiction. 0aTolerationzWest (U.S.)vFiction.  0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1135548414  c4474d4474
