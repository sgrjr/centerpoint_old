Old Order Amish forbid the creation of art without purpose, but without a husband, Regina has been free to explore the joy of painting in her attic. Yet when Gabe Flaud's curiosity leads him to speculate that Regina herself is the painter, the full weight of their community's judgement falls on her shoulders. When Gabe stands up to defend Regina, questioning the Order's restrictions, he reveals his own guilty secret and is shunned along with her. Forced to turn to each other for companionship, the young couple must learn to balance their own needs with their deep faith . . . and a love that will show them all things are possible."--cProvided by publisher. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aArtistsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201663922  c4671d4671
