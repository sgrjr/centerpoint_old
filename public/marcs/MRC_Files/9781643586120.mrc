Hashknife and his partner, Sleepy Stevens, accordingly turn up in that Arizona town, encountering there a mild-looking young man in horn-rimmed glasses and an expensive Stetson. This is Alexander Hamilton Montgomery, son of a Wall Street magnate and possessed by a notion about getting cow country material for a play he plans to write. There is a bank robbery in Antelope Flats. Things get complicated but with a little help from Montgomery, Hashknife and Sleepy clear things up and bring peace and happiness to Antelope Flats. The story is told with Tuttle's inimitable combination of gunplay and humor"--Provided by publisher. 0aBank robberiesvFiction. 0aCowboysvFiction. 0aArizonavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1137851519  c4503d4503
