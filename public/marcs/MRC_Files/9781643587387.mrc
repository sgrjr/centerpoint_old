She freezes; it's an image of a book she hasn't seen in sixty-five years -- a book she recognizes as The Book of Lost Names. The accompanying article discusses the looting of libraries by the Nazis across Europe during World War II -- an experience Eva remembers well -- and the search to reunite people with the texts taken from them so long ago. The book in the photograph, an eighteenth-century religious text thought to have been taken from France in the waning days of the war, is one of the most fascinating cases. As a graduate student in 1942, Eva was forced to flee Paris after the arrest of her father, a Polish Jew. Finding refuge in a small mountain town in the Free Zone, she begins forging identity documents for Jewish children fleeing to neutral Switzerland. But erasing people comes with a price, and along with a mysterious, handsome forger named Rémy, Eva decides she must find a way to preserve the real names of the children who are too young to remember who they really are. The records they keep in The Book of Lost Names will become even more vital when the resistance cell they work for is betrayed and Rémy disappears."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen librariansvFiction. 0aPhotographsvFiction. 0aCode and cipher stories. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xUnderground movementszFrancevFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945zFrancevFiction. 0aJewszFrancevFiction. 0aFrancexHistoryyGerman occupation, 1940-1945vFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193112290  c4640d4640
