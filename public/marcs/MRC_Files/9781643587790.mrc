The future of the American West is up for grabs. Any man crazy enough to lead a herd of Texas longhorns to the north stands to make a fortune -- and make history. That man would be Nelson Story. A bold entrepreneur and miner, he knows a golden opportunity when he sees one. But it won't be easy. Cowboys and bandits have got guns, farmers have got sick livestock, and the Army's got their own reasons to stop the drive. Even worse, Story's top hand is an ornery Confederate veteran who used to be his enemy. But all that is nothing compared to the punishing weather, the deadly stampedes -- and the bloodthirsty wrath of the Sioux."--cProvided by publisher. 0aCattle drivesvFiction. 0aCowboysvFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aWestern stories. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201679431  c4675d4675
