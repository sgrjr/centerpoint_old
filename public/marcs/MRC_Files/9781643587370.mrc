Ripples that cascade seventy-five years into the present. And two lives transformed by the tenuous resolve to reach out of the darkness toward fragments of light. Cancer stole everything from Ceelie -- her peace of mind, her self-image, perhaps even her twenty-three-year marriage to her college sweetheart, Nate. Without the support of Darlene, her quirky elderly friend, she may not have been able to endure so much loss. So when Darlene's prognosis turns dire, Ceelie can't refuse her seemingly impossible request -- to find a WWII paratrooper named Cal, the father who disappeared when Darlene was an infant, leaving a lifetime of desolation in his wake. The search that begins in the farmlands of Missouri eventually leads Ceelie to a small town in Normandy, where she uncovers the harrowing tale of the hero who dropped off-target into occupied France."--cProvided by publisher. 0aCancervFiction. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xCampaignszFrancezNormandyvFiction. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193119241  c4639d4639
