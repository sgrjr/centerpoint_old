It's the summer season in Chilson, Michigan, and the town is packed with tourists ready for a fabulous Fourth of July fireworks show. Minnie Hamilton and her rescue cat, Eddie, have spent a busy day on the bookmobile, delivering good cheer and great reads to even the library's most far-flung patrons. But Minnie is still up for the nighttime festivities, eager to show off her little town to her visiting niece, Katrina. But then, during the grand finale of the fireworks display, Katrina discovers a body. Minnie recognizes the victim as one of the bookmobile's most loyal patrons. And she knows she-and Eddie-will have to get to the bottom of this purr-fect crime"--Provided by publisher.10aHamilton, Minniec(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aWomen librariansvFiction. 0aCatsvFiction. 0aBookmobilesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aCass, Laurie.tBookmobile cat mystery ;vbk. 8.  c(OCoLC)1137838845  c4497d4497
