Though her new life as a wedding photographer provides a semblance of purpose, it's also a distraction from her profound pain. When asked to photograph a wedding at the historic Woodmont estate, Libby meets the owner, Elaine Grant. Hoping to open Woodmont to the public, Elaine has employed young widower Colton Reese to help restore the grounds and asks Libby to photograph the process. Libby is immediately drawn to the old greenhouse shrouded in honeysuckle vines. As Libby forms relationships and explores the overgrown - yet hauntingly beautiful - Woodmont estate, she finds the emotional courage to sort through her father's office. There she discovers a letter that changes everything she knows about her parents, herself and the estate. Beneath the vines of the old greenhouse lie generations of secrets and it's up to Libby to tend to the fruits born of long-buried seeds."--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen photographersvFiction. 0aFathersxDeathvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aGreenhousesvFiction. 0aLandscape architectsvFiction. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225190566  c4720d4720
