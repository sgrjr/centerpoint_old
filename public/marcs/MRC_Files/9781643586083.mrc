But he can outshoot them. Acclaimed author Sean Lynch's epic saga of Samuel Pritchard continues-with a venegance. 1874. After losing his innocence in the Civil War and risking his life as a Texas Ranger, Samuel Pritchard has finally settled into a peaceful life in his hometown of Atherton, Missouri. As marshall, he hopes to put his bloody past behind him. To see his sister marry his lifelong friend. To find a wife and raise a family. For the first time in his life, Pritchard isn't gunning for anyone-and no one is gunning for him. Or so he thinks. Strangers have arrived in Atherton. Hard-eyed men with guns. Someone has placed a bounty on Pritchard's head: $10,000 in gold, deposited anonymously in a Wells Fargo bank, payable to anyone who puts the legendary pistolero in a pine box. This is the story of Samuel Pritchard. A small-town sheriff with a larger-than-life reputation, lightning-fast guns, and a long list of enemies who'd love to see him dead"--Provided by publisher. 0aSheriffsvFiction. 0aBountiesvFiction. 0aMissourixHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1137816462  c4499d4499
