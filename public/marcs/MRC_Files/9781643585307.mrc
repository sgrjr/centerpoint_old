I know I haven't done much listening in the past, Lord, she prays. But I'm listening now. Her new friend, Cevilla Schlabach, urges her to let go of regrets and allow this to be a fresh start. Cevilla herself, though, hides a secret longing behind her weathered face. Levi Stoll and his family spent a year transforming a large English house into a small inn. Now that they are open for business, Levi is pleased to have Selah join them as an employee -- as long as his grandmother doesn't try any matchmaking schemes on the two of them. After all, Selah seems as guarded as he feels, and the last thing he wants is for anyone to remind him of his history"--Provided by publisher. 0aHotelsvFiction. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft1 aFuller, Kathleen.tAmish brides of Birch Creek ;v03.  c(OCoLC)1129458909
