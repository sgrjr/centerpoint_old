When Parker fires Jimmy, all Jimmy can think is how he will hurt Muriel Aiken, his fiancâee, who wants to marry. When his father signs over the old family homestead to him that is in serious need of repair, Jimmy feels better. But an unexpected invitation from Parker to meet him at the Club convinces him that Parker wants him back. When he learns what Parker really has in mind, Jimmy finds himself recalling the stories he has heard from his father about the notorious robber the White Streak and Utah Billie. He has to make a hard decision. In "The Masked Rider" the betrothed of Carlos Torreäno, Lucia d'Arquista, is making her way to Casa Torreäno in Spanish California in which no expense has been spared in making her journey a lavish one by her soon-to-be father-in-law, Francisco Torreäno. But it is on the journey that Francisco decides that Lucia is a sparrowhawk and that she must be watched carefully, especially once she takes an interest in Taki, a Navajo who is working off a debt to Francisco"--Provided by publisher.0 aThe white streak -- The masked rider. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd1 iContainer of (work):aBrand, Max,d1892-1944.tMasked rider. 0aCircle V western.  c(OCoLC)1137814008  c4500d4500
