Louisa's salvation is a position within the Mitford household at Asthall Manor, in the Oxfordshire countryside. There she will become nursery maid, chaperone and confidante to the Mitford sisters, especially sixteen-year-old Nancy - an acerbic, bright young woman in love with stories. But then a nurse - Florence Nightingale Shore, goddaughter of her famous namesake - is killed on a train in broad daylight, and Louisa and Nancy find themselves entangled in the crimes of a murderer who will do anything to hide their secret.10aNightingale, Florence,d1820-1910vFiction. 0aSistersvFiction. 0aNanniesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryyGeorge V, 1910-1936vFiction. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1019837279
