He'd left the Double S Ranch to pursue music against Sam's wishes and returns discouraged about life and love after tragically losing his wife. Trey feels that he's living a lie, singing of love and happily-ever-afters while dealing with an emptiness within. Will sacrificing part of himself to help Sam fill the void? Or could it come from befriending the single mother who needs help with her farm?  aIncludes recipes. 0aWidowersvFiction. 0aCountry musiciansvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Christian / Romance.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Christian / Western.2bisacsh 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd1 aHerne, Ruth Logan.tDouble S ranch ;vbk. 3.  c(OCoLC)0974487716
