While Nolan digs into the legalities of the findings, Jillian searches for the descendants of a stolen identity who might not be who they think they are on Colorado ranch land. When Drew seems anxious to hear what Jillian has to say but his Great Aunt Min slams the subject closed-twice-Jillian is all the more determined to find out what happened to the woman who never claimed her luggage, why Min doesn't want to talk about it, and what will happen for Drew if he gets the answers he seeks"--Provided by publisher. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aBed and breakfast accommodationsvFiction. 0aMountain lifevFiction. 0aGenealogistsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft1 aNewport, Olivia.tTree of life ;vbk. 3.  c(OCoLC)1142518521  c4521d4521
