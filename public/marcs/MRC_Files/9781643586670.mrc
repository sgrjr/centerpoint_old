Spurred by a desire to contribute meaningfully to the war effort, Lottie pours all of her focus and determination into becoming the best airplane mechanic in the division, working harder than she's ever worked before. Her grit impresses her handsome instructor, Captain Luke Woodward. But when the war ramps up and she is assigned to Pearl Harbor she must fight her growing feelings for Luke and navigate her role as one of the only female mechanics among a group of men, all while finding out what it means to be your own hero"--Provided by publisher.10aUnited States.bNaval Reserve.bWomen's ReservevFiction. 0aAviation mechanics (Persons)vFiction. 0aSex role in the work environmentvFiction. 0aSelf-actualization (Psychology) in womenvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xWomenzUnited StatesvFiction. 0aPearl Harbor (Hawaii)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aWar fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179262085  c4550d4550
