Finally relocating him as the pastor at her best friend's wedding was the very last thing she expected. A year ago, Jacey was trapped on a rooftop during a flood with perfect strangers, including a family and a man named Colin. After two days there together, she had no doubt that Colin was the man of her dreams. When they were finally rescued he tucked his phone number into her pocket. But an accident with the rescue boat left her hospitalized with amnesia, and his number nowhere to be found.  aIncludes discussion questions. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aAmnesiavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0978712926
