Now that she's divorced and her daughter, Ellery, is all grown up, Daphne's celebrating the best part of her life, a successful career, and a flirtation with an attentive hunk fifteen years her junior ... who happens to be her daughter's ex-boyfriend. Ellery is starting over, too. She's fresh out of college. Her job prospects are dim. And to support her fiancâe in med school, she's returned home as her mother's new assistant. Ellery never expected her own life plan to take such a detour. With no outlet for her frustration, she lets an online flirtation go a little too far, especially considering her pen pal thinks he's corresponding with her mother. As love lives tangle, secrets spill, and indiscretions are betrayed, mother and daughter will have a lot to learn-not only about the mistakes they've made but also about the men in their lives and the women they are each hoping to become"--Provided by publisher. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aDating (Social customs)vFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128195596
