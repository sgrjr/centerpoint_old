His daughter, Jillian, feels like she's the one being punished instead -- by having Tisha assigned to work with her on a backlog of genealogy files. Tisha doesn't seem interested in taking the job seriously, and Jillian's patience wears thin. Besides, everyone in Canyon Mines knows the Crowder family has experienced generations of brokenness. Then a sliver of hope turns up in long-ago words in plain sight, challenging shrouded assumptions about Tisha's family. Now Jillian is the one who can walk with Tisha back to 1893 and uncover where everything went wrong in the first place -- and save her from the past. What You Said to Me is the fourth book in the Tree of Life series by Olivia Newport. You'll want to return to the lovely Colorado mountain town of Canyon Mines again and again to explore and celebrate unforgettable family stories that will inspire you to connect with your own family histories and unique faith journeys."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen genealogistsvFiction. 0aMountain lifevFiction. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aLarge type books.1 aNewport, Olivia.tTree of life ;vbk. 4.  c(OCoLC)1225192636  c4699d4699
