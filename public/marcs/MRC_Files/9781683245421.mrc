But the Oregon frontier of the 1870s doesn't approve of such innovations as women attending medical school. To leave grief and guilt behind, as well as support herself and her challenging young son, Jennie cares for an elderly woman using skills she's developed on her own. When her patient dies, Jennie discovers that her heart has become entangled with the woman's widowed husband, a man many years her senior. Their unlikely romance may lead her to her ultimate goal--but the road will be winding and the way forward will not always be clear. Will Jennie find shelter in life's storms? Will she discover where healing truly lives?"--cProvided by Amazon.  aIncludes reader's guide. 0aWomen healerszOregony19th centuryvFiction. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifezOregony19th centuryvFiction. 0aOregonxHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0993752285
