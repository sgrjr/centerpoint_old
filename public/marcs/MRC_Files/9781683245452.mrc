When his prospects outside of the community dwindle, he decides to reconcile with his brother in Birch Creek, the last wish of his beloved grandmother, from her final letter to him. Leanna Chupp has always made her own way; she's called unconventional-- strange, even-- but is happy,  content being single. Neither Roman and Leanna fit squarely within the strictures of the Amish faith, but their differences could be the very thing to help them form a deeper connection to their community and to each other. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd1 aFuller, Kathleen.tAmish letters novel ;v2.  c(OCoLC)0990248487
