With all the mistakes she's made and the uncaring things she's done--even to her own family--she can hardly believe that happiness will find her, especially when Gabe Kendall, her first crush and her first kiss, rides back into her life atop a buckskin mare. A former Marine, Gabe is at loose ends after serving a prison sentence for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He sees beyond Amy's hard exterior to the girl he once knew and loved, and he longs to see her open her heart. Yet with his vision clouded by shame for his past and fears about the future, he finds it difficult to see the path ahead. But the memory of that long-ago kiss just may have the power to reignite a romance that brings out the best in both of them. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aFirst lovesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd1 aAlexander, Johnnie.tMisty Willow ;vbk. 3.  c(OCoLC)0978712949
