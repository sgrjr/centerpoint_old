As a result, she has zero time for extracurricular activities--including romance. Ex-con Adam Stone isn't looking for love either--but how ironic is it that the first woman to catch his eye is a police chief? Yet wishing for things that can never be is foolish. Nevertheless, when Lexie enlists Adam's help to keep a young man from falling into a life of crime, sparks begin to fly. And as they work together, it soon becomes apparent that God may have a different--and better--future planned for them than either could imagine. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aOregonvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd1 aHannon, Irene.tHope Harbor.  c(OCoLC)0972200757
