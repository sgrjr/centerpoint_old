Her husband Trevor is a bigshot producer, and from the outside it looks like they're living a picture-perfect celebrity life, complete with tennis tournaments and lavish parties. But the job description of a Hollywood wife doesn't cover divorce, which is the way Agnes' life is headed after she comes home one day to find her credit cards cancelled and the security passwords to get into her enormous LA home changed. Oh, and there's a guy there whose job it is to tase her if she tries to enter ... which she does. Needless to say, Agnes' husband is dead set on making sure she loses big time, but Agnes isn't the type to just lie down and take it. In a world of fremenies and hot nannies, personal psychics and "skinny" jello shots, Agnes may be losing her husband, but could that mean getting her own life back? Been There, Married That is a drop-dead hilarious battle of wills that will make you laugh out loud, cringe, and keep turning the pages to see what crazy disaster will happen to Agnes next...and how she'll rise from the ashes"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen authorsvFiction. 0aMotion picture producers and directorsvFiction. 0aMarried peoplevFiction. 0aDivorcevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129459456
