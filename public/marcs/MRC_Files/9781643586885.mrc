She can take care of herself -- until she's mugged. When Ace Vance comes to her rescue, she doesn't know how to accept his help -- or stop staring into his chocolate-brown eyes. Ace Vance moved to Bridgeport to offer his fifteen-year-old son, Finn, a better life. And Ace scored a job at a top-notch garage, where he gets to fix up classic cars. Thrown together by a careless criminal, Meredith and Ace can't deny their attraction. But can they open their hearts -- and their lives -- to make room for love?"--Provided by publisher. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aMugging victimsvFiction. 0aSingle fathersvFiction. 0aBusinesswomenvFiction. 0aPoker playersvFiction. 0aMale friendshipvFiction. 0aBridgeport (Ohio)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft1 aGray, Shelley Shepard.tBridgeport Social Club series ;vbk. 2.  c(OCoLC)1193130177  c4567d4567
