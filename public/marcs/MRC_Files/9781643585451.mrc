He reckoned he'd been there on the run for long enough after "mauling" a skunk of a man to death in Lander City. Now was his chance with Peyton, the gambler, wanting a herd taken through to Wyoming. At least it was "better than a 20-year stretch in jail." But to go would mean leaving lovely Mary Ballard and her brother alone on their range and up against evil-minded Skaggs and his outfit. While ahead lay the grueling drive, a cattleman's war and Lenora Trine with her body of untrammelled curves and dishonorable intentions"--Provided by publisher. 0aOutlawsvFiction. 0aRanchersvFiction. 0aGamblersvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1129459608
