The town had had enough of Hawk's brand of justice and when he went off on a fishing trip, everyone knew the only way he would come back was dead. But no one had counted on Deputy Johnny Jones, on his mission to arrest the town's richest, meanest, and most powerful hellraiser, on his courage to stand before hanging-hungry vigilantes and an innocent boy framed for murder, and on his gun being quick enough to face the man he hated on equal terms -- man to man and bullet to bullet."--cProvided by publisher. 0aSheriffszWest (U.S.)vFiction. 0aLaw enforcementzWest (U.S.)vFiction. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225190964  c4711d4711
