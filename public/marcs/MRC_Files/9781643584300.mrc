On a solo ski vacation in Canyon Mines, Colorado, Tucker has a love-hate relationship with his wealth, spending indiscriminately while skiing fearlessly and preparing to conquer the overgrown slope of Hidden Run, a dangerous run not attempted in decades. As genealogist Jillian tries to uncover enough of Tucker's family tree to understand his charming nature but reckless resolve, Jillian's equally charming father, Nolan, cajoles Tucker into giving him ski lessons to get him talking about the suspicious circumstances surrounding his grandfather's life in St. Louis in the 1930s"--Provided by publisher. 0aFathers and daughtersvFiction. 0aGenealogistsvFiction. 0aRich peoplevFiction. 0aColoradovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aChristian fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1113420555
