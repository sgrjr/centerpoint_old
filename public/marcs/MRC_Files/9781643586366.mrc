Refugees from Hungary, they escaped from a train headed for Auschwitz and were hidden by farmers until the end of the war while the rest of their families perished. Now, they want to start new lives abroad, and armed with a letter of recommendation from an American general, Vera finds work at the United States embassy and falls in love with Captain Anton Wight. But as Vera and Edith grapple with the aftermath of the war, so too does Anton, and when he disappears, Vera is forced to change course, trying to find refuge first in America (where she and Edith are turned away) and then in Venezuela. Their quest for a better life takes Vera and Edith from Naples to Ellis Island to Caracas as they start careers, reunite with old friends, and rebuild their lives after terrible loss"--Provided by publisher. 0aJewish womenvFiction. 0aJewish refugeesvFiction. 0aRefugeeszVenezuelavFiction. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aCaracas (Venezuela)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142516344  c4523d4523
