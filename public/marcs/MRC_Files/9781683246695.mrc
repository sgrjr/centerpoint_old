After one too many head injuries, hes off the circuit and in the horse farming business, something he's never taken much of a shine to, but now that its his late father's legacy, familial duty calls. How will Maverick find his way after the only dream he ever had for himself is over? Enter Leighton Elizabeth James, an ugly duckling turned beauty from Mavericks childhood, his younger sisters best friend, to be exact, and someone whose heart he stomped all over when she confessed her crush to him ten years back. Now Leighton is back in Maverick's life, no longer the insecure, love-stricken teen and Maverick can't help but take notice. Sparks fly between them, but will Leighton be able to open her heart to the one man who broke it all those years ago? 0aHorse farmsvFiction. 0aHomecomingvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd1 aSloan, Harper,d1984-tComing home series ;vbk. 1.  c(OCoLC)1010580956
