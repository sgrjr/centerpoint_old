A.  a"Samantha Fremont has been struggling with the weight of her mother's expectations for years. But now that her mother has passed away, it's time for Sam to be bold and finally establish the fashion design business she's always dreamed of. And the perfect opportunity has fallen into her lap. Her friend's getting married and has asked Sam to create her wedding dress. It's an honor -- and something that could launch Sam's career . . . if only she could avoid the bride's infuriating brother, who's temporarily the boy next door. Ian Summerhill knows a sabbatical in Haven Point is exactly what he and his children need to recover from their mother's death. His romantic relationship with his ex-wife may have ended years ago, but caring for her throughout her illness broke his heart. All he wants is to watch his little sister walk down the aisle and to see his kids smile again. And somehow his lovely new neighbor is instrumental in both. But as their uneasy truce blossoms into a genuine friendship and eventually into something more, Ian has obligations in England he can't ignore -- and a secret that threatens the fragile trust he and Sam have built."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWidowersvFiction. 0aFashion designersvFiction. 0aWeddingsvFiction. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.1 aThayne, RaeAnne.tHaven Point.  c(OCoLC)1193124275  c4642d4642
