Even her marriage would serve her people. Her husband would be chosen for her-for this was the way of royal existence. Still, Monet dreamt of owning true love-of owning choice in love. Thus, each time the raven-haired, sapphire-eyed, Crimson Knight of Karvana rode near-Monet knew regret-for in secret, she loved him-and she could not choose him. As an arrogant king from another kingdom wages war against Karvana, the Crimson Knight and Scarlet Princess will sacrifice and keep secrets to serve the kingdom and preserve the Heart of Karvana"--Provided by publisher. 0aKnights and knighthoodvFiction. 0aPrincessesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1113458143
