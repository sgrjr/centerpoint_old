C. Kinsey & Company, Inc.  a"The Ma単ana Kid, mysterious border vaquero, arrived in Guadalupe in the midst of a killing at the Cantina El Paseo. Accused of the crime, he escaped from the pursuing posse and disappeared into the sparsely settle Santa Ynez valley, mounted on his swift Palomino stallion. His determination to locate the real murderer led him into a series of exciting adventures. He had only one clue to work on - and a warning concerning the Rancho Diablo - but the Ma単ana Kid, in spite of his nickname, was not the type to be easily discouraged. How he came to the rescue of Maria Garcia and unmasked the man who had done the killing at Cantina El Paseo provides this novel with continued action and thrilling suspense. The Ma単ana Kid and his beautiful golden horse shared the honors as they returned victorious to Rancho Diablo"--Provided by publisher. 0aOutlawszCaliforniavFiction. 0aRancherszCaliforniavFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aSwindlers and swindlingzCaliforniavFiction. 0aCaliforniavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1142524023  c4532d4532
