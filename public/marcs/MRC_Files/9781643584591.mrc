But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children. Nancy tumbled once, but now she's back. The things she's experienced ... they change a person. The children under Miss West's care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world. But Nancy's arrival marks a change at the Home. There's a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it's up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter. No matter the cost"--Provided by publisher.  aAlex Award winner, 2017  aHugo Award for Best Novella, 2017  aNebula Award for Best Novella, 2016  aLocus Award for Best Novella, 2017  aJames Tiptree Jr. Award Honor List, 2016 0aChildrenxInstitutional carevFiction. 0aMagicvFiction. 0aSchoolsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFantasy fiction.2lcgft1 aMcGuire, Seanan.tWayward children ;v1.  c(OCoLC)1122800241
