But when a wealthy family wants to buy the island and Jesse's cousin Simon petitions for power of attorney to force him to sell, Jesse is the one who becomes endangered. Mainely Needlepointer Dave Perry, who befriended Jesse in the VA hospital, rallies the group to his defense. Angie Curtis and the ravelers stitch "Save the King's Island Cormorants" pillows and sell T-shirts to pay for Jesse's legal counsel. But tragically, on a visit to the island, Angie finds Jesse dead. Now the search is on for a common thread that can tie the murdered man to his killer. 0aBird refugeszMainevFiction. 0aCanvas embroideryvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aMainevFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd1 aWait, Lea.tMainely needlepoint mystery.  c(OCoLC)1005192681
