A city where the suffrage movement is growing stronger every day, but most women reporters are still delegated to the fashion and lifestyle pages. But Vera Garland is set on making her mark in a man's world of serious journalism. Shortly after the world-famous Hope Diamond is acquired for a record sum, Vera begins investigating rumors about schemes by its new owner, jeweler Pierre Cartier, to manipulate its value. Vera is determined to find the truth behind the notorious diamond and its legendary curses-even better when the expose puts her in the same orbit as a magazine publisher whose blackmailing schemes led to the death of her beloved father. Appealing to a young Russian jeweler for help, Vera is unprepared when she begins falling in love with him ... and even more unprepared when she gets caught up in his deceptions and finds herself at risk of losing all she has worked so hard to achieve. Set against the backdrop of New York's glitter and grit, of ruthless men and the atrocities they commit in the pursuit of power, this enthralling historical novel explores our very human needs for love, retribution-and to pursue one's destiny, regardless of the cost"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aHope diamondvFiction. 0aJewelry tradexCorrupt practicesvFiction. 0aJewelerszRussiavFiction. 0aDeceptionvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aNineteen tensvFiction. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xSocial life and customsy20th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1137844129  c4477d4477
