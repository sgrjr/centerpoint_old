The fact that they're strictly friends seems to get lost on nearly everyone; after all, they're as good as married in (almost) every way. For three decades, they've nurtured their baby, the Forsyth Trio - a chamber group they created as college students - but now their beloved trio is missing its violinist and floundering. Bridget has been dreaming of spending the summer at her rustic Connecticut country home with her boyfriend, Sterling. But her plans are suddenly upended when he breaks up with her over email, and then her twin twenty-something children arrive unannounced, filling her empty nest with their big dogs, dirty laundry, and respective crises. 0aFriendshipvFiction. 0aMusiciansvFiction. 0aChamber music groupsvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aHumorous fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225192357  c4733d4733
