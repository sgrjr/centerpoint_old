The boys' parents, well-known German playwrights, have left the brothers in their aunt's care until they can find safe harbor for their family. But before the Steins can reunite, a great and terrifying roundup occurs. The French gendarmes, under Nazi order, arrest the boys and take them to the Vélodrome d'Hiver-a massive, bleak structure in Paris where thousands of France's Jews are being forcibly detained. Jacob and Moses know they must flee in order to survive, but they only have a set of letters sent from the south of France to guide them to their parents. Danger lurks around every corner as the boys, with nothing but each other, trek across the occupied country. Along their remarkable journey, they meet strangers and brave souls who put themselves at risk to protect the children-some of whom pay the ultimate price for helping these young refugees of war."--Provided by publisher. 0aBrothersvFiction. 0aJewish childrenzFrancevFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945xJewszFrancevFiction. 0aWorld War, 1939-1945zFrancevFiction. 0aSeparation (Psychology)vFiction. 0aEscapesvFiction. 0aFrancexHistoryyGerman occupation, 1940-1945vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aWar fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142517101  c4518d4518
