A quiltmaker by trade, Millie has nevertheless stitched together a few lives in her time, with truly romantic results. Her first mission? Her own niece, widowed gardener Edith Hochstetler, recently engaged to rude, greedy Zeke Miller. Anyone can see he's not right for such a gentle young woman-except Edith herself. Pleased when she convinces the bride-to-be to leave her betrothed before the wedding, Millie is later panicked to find Zeke in Edith's greenhouse - as dead as a tulip in the middle of winter. To keep her niece out of prison-and to protect her own reputation - Millie will have to piece together a patchwork of clues to find a killer, before she becomes the next name on his list."--Provided by publisher. 0aAmishvFiction. 0aQuiltmakersvFiction. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1135581117  c4468d4468
