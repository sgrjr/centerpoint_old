But since her ex-husband's betrayal, she has trouble trusting anyone. Jett Glover's father committed suicide over a false newspaper report that ruined his reputation. Now a fierce champion of truth, Jett is writing the story of his journalism career-an international sex-trafficking expos√© that will bring down a celebrity baseball player and the men closest to him, including Savannah's ex-husband. When Jett's story breaks, tragedy ensues. Then a commercial airline crashes, and one of Savannah's clients is implicated in the crash. Men connected to the scandal, including her ex, begin to die amid mysterious circumstances, and Savannah's niece becomes an unwitting target. Against their better instincts, Jett and Savannah join ranks to sort the facts from fiction. But can Savannah trust the reporter who threw her life into chaos? And can Jett face the possibility that he's made the biggest mistake of his life?"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen lawyersvFiction. 0aJournalistsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aScandalsvFiction. 0aHuman traffickingvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aRomantic suspense fiction.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142519388  c4520d4520
