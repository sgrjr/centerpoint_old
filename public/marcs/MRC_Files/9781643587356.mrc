But freedom comes at a cost. Left with little memory of the horrific ordeal, Dan can recall one thing -- his escape meant leaving his brother behind. With each day that passes, Dan waits with the other survivors in hope of his brother's escape. But just as long-forgotten memories start rising to the surface, the sudden appearance of a wounded woman throws everything into question. As Dan struggles to know who to trust, he is caught once again in a paralyzing moral dilemma: How far will he go to save the people he loves?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aSurvivalvFiction. 0aBrothersvFiction. 0aGuiltvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aMemoryvFiction. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193123106  c4637d4637
