The lawless call it an easy target. Joe O'Malley calls it home. If anybody can tame a wild, violent territory, it's the seasoned frontiersman. So can his family, who have the same pride and honor coursing through their veins. Helping to plant roots is his son Jackson, a former wrangler married to a steadying force of nature. Joe's grandchildren have their own brand of grit. The boy - a firebrand with a knife. The girl - book-smart and wicked-wise. But Whip Station is also hunting ground for Mexican revolutionaries, savage Indians, post-war renegade Confederates, and the deadliest outlaws who ever drew a breath. It's time for the O'Malleys to take aim. With a rawhide-tough will to survive, they're banding together to protect their future against the most savage odds imaginable"--Provided by publisher. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifezTexasvFiction. 0aFamilieszTexasvFiction. 0aMassacresvFiction. 0aOutlawsvFiction. 0aStagecoach lineszTexasvFiction. 0aTexasxHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aWest (U.S.)xHistoryy1860-1890vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft1 aRichards, Dusty.tO'Malley's of Texas ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1142518535  c4529d4529
