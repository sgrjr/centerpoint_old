Job 4:13-14. After a brutal incident, Jessica Chamberlain changes jobs, moves, and adopts a rowdy, partially trained German Shepherd, Luke. The two begin training with a Virginia K-9 search-and-rescue group. The group's training director, Nathan Tanner, a former military war dog handler with scars of his own, sees signs of stress in Jess. He'd like to share the hope he's found -- if she'd let him. On their first big test, Jess's dog makes an unplanned discovery: the body of a young woman, a murder victim, lying in the woods. Drawn into the FBI's hunt for a serial killer, Jess finds herself tormented by her past -- and terrified of her future. Can the secrets of her late father give her the strength she needs to carry on?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aSearch dogsvFiction. 0aRescue dogsvFiction. 0aVirginiavFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225193045  c4730d4730
