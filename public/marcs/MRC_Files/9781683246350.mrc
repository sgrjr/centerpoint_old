As the daughter of a presidential candidate, Cassidy Hamilton left the Montana family ranch to escape notoriety and live her own life. But when someone tries to abduct her off a Houston sidewalk, Cassidy finds protection in the tall, dark and sexy form of cowboy Jack Durand. The gorgeous Texan doesn't recognise her, wants nothing from her and is determined to keep her safe. Jack hates keeping secrets from the beautiful Cassidy, but he knows more about her kidnapping attempt than he's admitting. Forced on the run, Jack and Cassidy begin piecing together a jagged family puzzle, exposing a plot years in the making--one that will either tear them apart or bring them closer together than ever. 0aCowboysvFiction. 0aKidnapping victimsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aMontanavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aWestern stories.2gsafd1 aDaniels, B.
