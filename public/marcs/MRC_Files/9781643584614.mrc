The situation would just be temporary-three years at the most-then they would sell the inn and Molly could get back to chasing her own dreams. Adam Bradford (aka bestselling author Nathanial Grey) is a reclusive novelist with a bad case of writer's block. Desperate for inspiration as his deadline approaches, he travels to the setting of his next book, a North Carolina lake town. There he immediately meets his muse, a young innkeeper who fancies herself in love with his alter ego. Molly and Adam strike up an instant friendship. When Molly finds a long-lost letter in the walls of her inn she embarks on a mission with Adam to find the star-crossed lovers and bring them the closure they deserve. But Adam has secrets of his own. Past and present collide as truths are revealed, and Molly and Adam will have to decide if love is worth trusting"--Provided by publisher. 0aBrothers and sistersvFiction. 0aAuthorsvFiction. 0aHotelkeepersvFiction. 0aLettersvFiction. 0aNorth CarolinavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122804694
