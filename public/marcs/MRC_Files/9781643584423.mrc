Then Sheriff Tom Chisholm offered Matt a chance to clear their names. After pulling a fake robbery of the mercantile, Matt would be sent to Stone Lodge prison to get close to the ones the sheriff believed had robbed the train, escape with them, and recover the stolen gold to clear his name. But when Matt arrives at the mercantile, someone else has already robbed it and killed the owner. The only reason Matt isn't hanged is because they hope he will reveal what he did with the $30,000 dollars that was stolen. He is sent to Stone Lodge, not sure if the sheriff's plan will work or if he will ever be able to prove his innocence of either crime"--Provided by publisher. 0aTrain robberiesvFiction. 0aPrisonersvFiction. 0aMurdervFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1112905854
