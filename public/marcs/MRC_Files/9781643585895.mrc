In her final dying moments, she thrusts a letter into Bella's hand. It's an offer of employment in the kitchens of Buckingham Palace, and everything the budding young chef desperately wants: an escape from the constrictions of her life as a lowly servant. In the stranger's stead, Bella can spread her wings. Arriving as Helen Barton from Yorkshire, she pursues her passion for creating culinary delights, served to the delighted Queen Victoria herself. Best of all, she's been chosen to accompany the queen to Nice. What fortune! Until the threat of blackmail shadows Bella to the Riviera, and a member of the queen's retinue falls ill and dies. Having prepared the royal guest's last meal, Bella is suspected of the poisonous crime. An investigation is sure to follow. Her charade will be over. And her new life will come crashing down-if it doesn't send her to the gallows"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen cooksvFiction. 0aImpostors and imposturevFiction. 0aHousehold employeeszEnglandvFiction. 0aPoisoningvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLondon (England)xSocial life and customsy19th centuryvFiction. 0aNice (France)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1137844321  c4480d4480
