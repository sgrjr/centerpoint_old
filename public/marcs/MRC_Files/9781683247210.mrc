Thus, Coquette dwelt in gladness until the day her father returned from his travels with an astonishing tale to tell. Antoine de Bellamont returned from his travels by way of Roanan bearing a tale of such great adventure to hardly be believed. Further, at the center of Antoine's story loomed a man-- the dark Lord of Roanan. Known for his cruel nature, heartlessness, and tendency to violence, the Lord of Roanan had accused Antoine de Bellamont of wrong doing and demanded recompense. Antoine had promised recompense would be paid-- with the hand of his youngest daughter in marriage. Thus, Coquette found herself lost-thrust onto a dark journey of her own."--cCover. 0aFolklorezFrance. 0aFairy tales. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1019840855
