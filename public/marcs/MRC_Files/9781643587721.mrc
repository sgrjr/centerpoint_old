She found it in Penance, a rugged town of miners and lumberjacks in the Dakota Territory. In the shadow of the Black Hills, she became Miss Aggie, respected schoolteacher and confirmed old maid -- despite being only twenty-four. But the past has a way of catching up with people. When childhood friend and former sweetheart James Harris accepts a position as the town doctor, Aggie's pleasantly predictable days suddenly become anything but. James wants to know why Agnes left behind the life they had dreamed of creating for themselves -- but he is precisely the one person who can never know. Can a healing light be shed on the past? Or will the secret Agnes can't seem to outrun destroy her chance at happiness?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen teachersy19th centuryvFiction. 0aPhysiciansy19th centuryvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aDakota TerritoryvFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201661174  c4668d4668
