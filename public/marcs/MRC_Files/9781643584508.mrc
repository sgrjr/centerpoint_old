But I'm settled now. In a place I love, in a home I renovated, spending time with new friends I adore, and working a job that fulfills me. I am reconciling the past and laying the groundwork for the future. Then Garrett Frost moves in next door. He's obstinate and too bold, a raging force of nature that disrupts the careful order of my life. I recognize the ghosts that haunt him, the torment driving him. Garrett would be risky in any form, but wounded, he's far more dangerous. I fear I'm too fragile for the storm raging inside him, too delicate to withstand the pain that buffets him. But he's too determined ... and too tempting. And sometimes hope soars above even the iciest desolation"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen physiciansvFiction. 0aDivorced womenvFiction. 0aSexual attractionvFiction. 0aNeighborsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aPuget Sound (Wash.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122802273
