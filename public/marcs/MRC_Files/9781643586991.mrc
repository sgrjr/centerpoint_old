She wants nothing more than to hide and wait for the tabloids to die down. Soon after her arrival at the Bluebell Inn, Mia meets Levi Bennett, who runs the inn along with his two younger sisters. Drawn to one another from the start, Mia trusts Levi to keep her location from the press, and Levi confides in Mia about the financial state of the inn--a secret he's been keeping from his sisters"--Provided by publisher. 0aHotelkeepersvFiction. 0aActressesvFiction. 0aNorth CarolinavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft1 aHunter, Denise,d1968-tBluebell Inn romance ;v2.  c(OCoLC)1193134887  c4578d4578
