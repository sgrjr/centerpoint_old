Birmingham, 1880. Angelica Chastain has fled from London with her young son, William. She promises him a better life, far away from the terrors they left behind. Securing a job as a governess, Angelica captures the attention of wealthy widower Stanley Hampton. Soon they marry and the successful future Angelica envisaged for William starts to fall into place. But the past will not let Angelica go. As the people in her husband's circle, once captivated by her charm, begin to question her motives, it becomes clear that forgetting where she came from-and who she ran from-is impossible. When tragedy threatens to expose her and destroy everything she's built for herself and William, how far will she go to keep her secrets safe? And when does the love for one's child tip over into dangerous obsession?"--Provided by publisher. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aMothers and sonsvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aSocial classesvFiction. 0aAmbitionvFiction. 0aEnglandxSocial life and customsy19th centuryvFiction. 0aBirmingham (England)xHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129458965
