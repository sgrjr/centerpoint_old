When he and Deputy Steve Larson were charged with taking the outlaw Luther Gibbs to the newly established Yuma Territorial Prison, he wasn't expecting any problems. When Larson gets snake bit and dies, Fyffe finds himself almost three days away from the Yuma prison with no one to spell him while he sleeps. Gibbs and his gang had stolen $25,000 from Southwestern, but only Gibbs knew where it was hidden and he knew the gang would be looking for their leader. It doesn't take long for Gibbs's gang to find them when Fyffe shoots his gun at Gibbs when he tries to get away. Fyffe is overtaken by the gang and suffers at their hands. The gang hatches a plan for Gibbs to pose as Fyffe and one of his men to pose as Larson. They deliver Fyffe to Yuma prison, claiming he is Luther Gibbs. In spite of Fyffe's insistence that he is in fact the federal marshal, he finds himself as prisoner number 109. Now in addition to fearing that Gibbs will get to the money and get away, Fyffe must survive in a prison where he is sure that someone he has sent to prison will recognize him"--Provided by publisher. 0aUnited States marshalsvFiction. 0aOutlawsvFiction.20aArizona Territorial PrisonvFiction. 0aFalse imprisonmentvFiction. 0aYuma (Ariz.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 0aCircle V Western.  c(OCoLC)1142523980  c4530d4530
