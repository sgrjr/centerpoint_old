Iris Maynard lost her husband in World War II, her daughter to loneliness and, finally, her reason to live. Walled off from the world for decades behind a towering fence surrounding her home and gardens, Iris has built a new family ... of flowers. Iris propagates her own daylilies and roses while tending to an heirloom garden filled with starts-and memories of her own mother, grandmother, husband and daughter. When Abby Peterson moves to Grand Haven, Michigan, with her family-a husband traumatized during his service in the Iraq War and a young daughter searching for stability-they find themselves next door to Iris, and are slowly drawn into their reclusive neighbor's life where, united by loss and a love of flowers, Iris and Abby slowly unearth their secrets"--Provided by publisher. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aWidowsvFiction. 0aFlower gardeningvFiction. 0aMichiganvFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1137841774  c4476d4476
