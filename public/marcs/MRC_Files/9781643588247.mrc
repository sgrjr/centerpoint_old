The winds of change are blowing through Scotland Street. Though Bertie is getting older, he can't resist an adventure to escape his domineering mother, and Bruce, ever the navel-gazer, will have to bring his best self to navigate the complexities of the pas de deux. While Alexander McCall Smith's delightfully warm and witty comedy takes some surprising turns, the improbable adventures of this quirky cast of Scots will affirm the heart and joy in Edinburgh's New Town. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aNeighborsvFiction. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aCity and town lifevFiction. 0aApartment houseszScotlandzEdinburghvFiction. 0aNew Town (Edinburgh, Scotland)xSocial life and customsvFiction. 7aHumorous fiction.2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.1 aMcIntosh, Iain,eillustrator.1 aMcCall Smith, Alexander,d1948-t44 Scotland Street series ;v14.  c(OCoLC)1230151613  c4714d4714
