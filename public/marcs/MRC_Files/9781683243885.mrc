Then Elizabeth makes it known that Terry will inherit the family ranch on his twenty-fifth birthday, not her ne'er-do-well brother, Vance. As the celebration nears, Vance decides that he must make Terry aware of his outlaw heritage, and who better to set the record straight than the lawman whose career was launched when he shot and killed Black Jack Hollis. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0971512297
