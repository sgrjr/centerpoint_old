But none of the women are prepared when their daughters decide to enlist in the army together. Facing an empty nest won't be easy ... With nothing to lose and no one at home, the girlfriends impulsively accept an unexpected offer from their elderly neighbor. The recently widowed Tootsie has an RV, a handsome nephew at the wheel, and an aim for tiny Scrap, Texas, to embrace memories of her late husband. Still grieving, she can use the company as a balm for her broken heart. So can the empty nesters. Embarking on a journey of hope, romance, and healing, Diana, Carmen, and Joanie are at a turning point in their lives. And with the open road ahead of them, it's just the beginning."--Provided by publisher. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aArmy spouseszUnited StatesvFiction. 0aOlder womenzUnited StatesvFiction. 0aIntergenerational relationsvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aRecreational vehiclesvFiction. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aRoad fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1135577970  c4447d4447
