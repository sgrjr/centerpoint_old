Tough, daring, unbeatable, they lived by the law of the gun and, if necessary, they were ready to die . . . by the law of the gun. Roud Vaughn: A gunslinger who wants to put the past behind him inherits a small ranch and big trouble. Two powerful warring neighbors control his assets. One holds his cattle, the other his money in "Gunslingers of the Cibola." Joe Sanders: He tries to tame a range before he tames his hair-trigger temper in "The Six-gun Sins of Smokey Joe." Wing Erth: A gambler's talent for fast talking and fast shooting is put to the test when he backs a notorious woman in a land war in "Tramp Gunfighter." Jim Harrigan: With the law hot on his trail, an outlaw on the dodge takes time out to help a lovely bandit queen go straight in "Exile of the Valiant.""--cProvided by publisher. 0aOutlawsvFiction. 0aGhost townsvFiction. 0aArizonavFiction. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aShort stories.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225189786  c4712d4712
