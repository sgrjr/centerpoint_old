Born in Kuwait in the 70s to Palestinian refugees, she dreamed of falling in love with the perfect man, raising children, and possibly opening her own beauty salon. Instead, the man she thinks she loves jilts her after a brief marriage, her family teeters on the brink of poverty, she's forced to prostitute herself, and the US invasion of Iraq makes her a refugee, as her parents had been. After trekking through another temporary home in Jordan, she lands in Palestine, where she finally makes a home, falls in love, and her destiny unfolds under Israeli occupation."--cProvided by publisher. 0aPrisoners, Palestinian ArabzIsraelvFiction. 0aRadicalszMiddle EastvFiction. 0aRefugees, Palestinian ArabvFiction. 0aWomen, Palestinian ArabvFiction. 0aArab-Israeli conflictvFiction. 0aSurvivalvFiction. 0aPalestinexHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 0aMiddle EastxPolitics and governmenty1945-vFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201659389  c4660d4660
