She begins her story with the discovery that she has been disinherited in her mother's will, her existence as a member of the family erased, and she writes with unflinching candor about growing up in a household whose members were devoted to hiding the truth. The younger and infinitely more pliant of two sisters, she was affected from early childhood by her family's obsessive focus on the unsteady mental health of her older sister, Lara, and by their alternating bouts of pushing away and demanding loyalty from her, all in service to supporting deep-seated family myths"--Provided by publisher.10aFremont, Helen.10aFremont, HelenxFamily. 0aChildren of Holocaust survivorszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aLarge type books. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1137829524  c4483d4483
