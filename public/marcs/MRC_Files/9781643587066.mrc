Chloe Sanderson is an optimist, and not because her life is easy. As the sole caregiver for her father, who has early onset Alzheimer's, she's pretty much responsible for everything. She has no time--or interest--in getting swept up in some dazzling romance. Not like her best friend Annie, who literally wrote a rom-com that's about to premiere in theaters across America ... and happens to be inspired by Chloe and Nick Velez, Chloe's cute but no-nonsense boss. As the buzz for the movie grows, Chloe reads one too many listicles about why Nick is the perfect man, and now she can't see him as anything but Reason #2: The Scruffy-Bearded Hunk Who's Always There When You Need Him. But unlike the romance Annie has written for them, Chloe isn't so sure her own story will end in a happily ever after"--Provided by publisher. 0aCaregiversvFiction. 0aFathers and daughtersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHumorous fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193133986  c4585d4585
