But the town had changed - drastically. Fear rode his former friends and neighbors, for Jud Laws and his hired killers had taken over, ruthlessly annexing ranches to his already enormous holdings, stealing cattle, and getting a stranglehold on the law. Anyone who balked was either killed or run out of town. And Ellen? Even she was now Jud Laws' property, basking in the reflected glory of the violent man's power. It was a bitter homecoming. Gone were his ranch, his woman - and maybe his right to live - unless he could gather the last few stragglers remaining in town with guts enough to ride against a determined man backed by forty gunslingers!"--Provided by publisher. 0aOutlawsvFiction. 0aRanchesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1179249329  c4561d4561
