Reeling, she leaves Toronto for Ireland just in time to celebrate her great-aunt Reverend Mother Brigid's eightieth birthday. It's a long-awaited reunion for her family, bringing her mother Keelin and grandmother Imelda-who have never quite gotten along-together as well. Then all hell breaks loose. Bitter, jealous Imelda makes a startling revelation at the party that forces them all to confront their pasts and face the truths that have shaped their lives. With four fierce, opinionated women in one family, will they ever be able to find common ground and move forward?"--Provided by publisher. 0aFamilieszIrelandvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aFamily reunionsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179277433  c4553d4553
