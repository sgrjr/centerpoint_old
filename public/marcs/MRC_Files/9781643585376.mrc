But instead of using her second chance to move forward, she's stuck promoting the memoir her brother convinced her to write, thus reliving the very battle she wants to forget. If she hopes her European book tour will allow her to enjoy revisiting her favorite travel-writing destinations, she's wrong: her PR whiz is too consumed with his own goals to consider her needs. Mitch Mathis has relied on discipline to achieve his goals, and with his new firm's success riding on Peyton's book launch, he must keep her on task. They're here for business, not pleasure. And Mitch won't let unbridled desire harm his professional reputation-not again. When frustrated expectations and attraction throw the tour into chaos, it challenges everything Mitch and Peyton believe about themselves, life, and love, forcing these opposites to consider whether they can embrace the change they need to grow"--Provided by publisher. 0aBreastxCancerxPatientsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aWomen authorsvFiction. 0aPress agentsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft1 aBeck, Jamie.tSanctuary Sound novel ;v3.  c(OCoLC)1129459369
