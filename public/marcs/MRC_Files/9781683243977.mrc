Soon after arriving in this elegant East European city, however, she helps an elderly couple into a taxi--and realizes too late that she has accidentally kept one of their bags. Inside she finds an ornately carved wooden box engraved with a name: Stoyan Lazarov. Raising the hinged lid, she discovers that she is holding an urn filled with human ashes. As Alexandra sets out to locate the family and return this precious item, she will first have to uncover the secrets of a talented musician who was shattered by oppression--and she will find out all too quickly that this knowledge is fraught with its own danger. 0aAmericanszBulgariavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Literary.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Suspense.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Psychological.2bisacsh 7aSuspense fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0974213257
