That means taking away their cell phones, tablets, and computers-at least temporarily-and moving to the house where Lily grew up in the rural town of Comfort, Texas. But Lily has a bigger challenge than two sulking kids. The house comes with Mack Cooper, high school teacher and handsome longtime renter. The arrangement: just housemates. But Mack's devoted attention to the kids starts to warm Lily's resistant heart. Then Lily finds an old leather-bound book in which five generations of her female ancestors shared their struggles and dreams. To Lily, it's a bracing reminder about the importance of family ... and love. Now it's time for Lily to add an adventurous new chapter to the cherished family journal-by embracing a fresh start and taking a chance on a man who could make her house a home"--Provided by publisher. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aHomecomingvFiction. 0aMale teachersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aDiariesxAuthorshipvFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142529049  c4507d4507
