At thirty-two, they are content to live with their parents and help them in their store in Sullivan, Illinois. But when their father's parents are killed in an accident, the girls inherit their grandparents house and store in Topeka, Indiana. At their Dad's encouragement, the twins make the move to Indiana. Looking for ways to be part of their new community, the twins volunteer to bake a cake for an Amish charity auction, only to learn they must demonstrate the whole process on stage in front of an audience. Bumbling their way through their grandmother's Christmas cake recipe, the take-charge Elma and the klutzy optimist Thelma manage to entertain their audience--and attract the admiration of two bachelors, an outspoken woodworker and a shy harness maker from a neighboring Amish community. More than one man will make a staggering bid for their cake. Could a lopsided Christmas cake be the key to opening the door to romance for one or more of the Hochstetler twins? 0aAmishvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aChristmas stories. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd1 aBrunstetter, Jean,eauthor.
