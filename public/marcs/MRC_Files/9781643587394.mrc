She'll finish renovating his Victorian mansion in rural Virginia, but with her own twist. She'll turn the old house into a creative retreat for artists and writers. Kara has never tackled a project this big alone, and she's not ready to open her heart to others for help. But the locals open their hearts to her -- including two who have the potential to be more than friends. She tells herself she doesn't need romance or distractions, but maybe that's exactly what she needs. When her former best friend reenters Kara's life, it could be the distraction that finally destroys her -- or heals her. The tragedies in Kara's life have damaged her self-confidence, but she presses forward, gradually lowering her protective walls and allowing others in little by little. Will bringing Wildflower House back to life and freeing her own creative spirit also allow her to open her heart to hope and happiness -- and maybe even love?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aInterpersonal relationsvFiction. 0aGriefvFiction. 0aBest friendsvFiction. 0aMansionsvFiction. 0aLife change eventsvFiction. 0aVirginiavFiction. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193111583  c4641d4641
