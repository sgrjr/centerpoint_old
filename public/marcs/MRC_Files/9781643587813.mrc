So how did this rootin'-tootin' cowboy -- who only wanted the money he figured was due him for a train-triggerd stampede -- find himself working as an undercover agent for two most unusual railroad owners and the notorious Wild Bill Hickok? And furthermore, what was he doing in a situation where not only were a lot of self-declared enemies out to gun him down but even his supposed friends had to pretend that he was an outlaw and a man that Sioux Wells would be better off without?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aCattle drivesvFiction. 0aRailroad stories.10aHickok, Wild Bill,d1837-1876vFiction. 7aWestern stories.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201656847  c4677d4677
