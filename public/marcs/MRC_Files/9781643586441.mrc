King.  a"New Mexico in the dread, dry year, and yet, Eagle Strange, old, blind cowman, living in retirement on his range Big Springs, with his only daughter, Memory, is unaffected by the drought until sheep threaten to invade his stronghold. The old man sends for his two oldest sons but they fail him. He is too proud to send for Quinn, his estranged son. But Memory sends for him, and when in his stead comes Dirk Haskell, the pal for whom Quinn has renounced all, the stage is set for gripping drama and stirring romance. In the ensuing conflict over the range - a conflict which brings in hired guns from distant parts - the circumstances which made it impossible for Quinn to answer his sister's call are made clear, with many unexpected surprises"--Provided by publisher. 0aBrothers and sistersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aGunfightsvFiction. 0aNew MexicovFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142524695  c4531d4531
