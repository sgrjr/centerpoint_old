Now Celia has discovered that the man her good friend plans to marry this Christmas is far from what he seems. His first marriage ended with his wife walking into the sea -- not of her own accord -- and Celia hopes Hooper can help show her friend the truth. But Celia herself has not always been truthful -- especially not in the murder trial following her cousin's death. How can she be believed now when she lied on the stand? With Christmas fast approaching and both Celia and her friend's lives on the line, Hooper must put his own moral code to the test "--cProvided by publisher. 0aPolicezEnglandzLondonvFiction. 0aCriminal investigationvFiction. 0aMarriagevFiction. 0aChristmas stories. 7aHistorical fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.1 aPerry, Anne.tChristmas novels.  c(OCoLC)1193123810  c4624d4624
