Hoping to find the memories of a lost pregnancy that's left her husband devastated and their home empty, Ella begins delving into her past when she's assigned an exclusive story about Nathan Donovan, a retired celebrity adventurer. To unravel the mystery of her selective memory loss, Ella follows Nathan from the snowcapped Sierra Nevada to the frozen slopes of southeast Alaska. There she discovers the people she trusts most aren't the only ones keeping secrets from her-she's hiding them from herself. Ella quickly learns that some truths are best left forgotten"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistsvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aAmnesiavFiction. 0aMemoryxPsychological aspectsvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1111697961
