His lungs, damaged from malaria during the Spanish-American War, could use a rest. But when the people of Nogales got the mistaken impression that he was a gunman instead of a gunsmith, Logan suddenly found himself the target of jeers -- and bullets. All of which made it harder to uncover the truth about the missing Rip Parrish, especially when the evidence pointed to murder, and the chief suspect was Rip's bewitchingly beautiful wife."--cProvided by publisher. 0aMissing personsvFiction. 0aArizonavFiction. 0aWestern stories. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201681715  c4680d4680
