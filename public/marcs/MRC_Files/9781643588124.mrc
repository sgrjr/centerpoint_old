But as a children's book publisher hosts a gathering there, some folks aren't going to live -- happily ever after or otherwise . . . Jane Steward's resort is hopping -- not only is Peppermint Press's conference in full swing, there are also lots of families staying on the premises, bringing their kids to events like a scavenger hunt through the Fairy Tale Forest. Then a woman dressed like Little Red Riding Hood is found dead from a plot device straight out of a fairy tale -- with a rare and valuable copy of Grimms' Fairy Tales in her basket. Not long after, a second victim is killed, with yet another treasure nearby -- a volume by Hans Christian Andersen worth thousands of dollars. It looks like a big bad wolf may be lurking among the guests, and Jane can't just wait for a handsome prince to come to the rescue."--cProvided by publisher.10aSteward, Janec(Fictitious character)vFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationzVirginiavFiction. 0aResortsvFiction. 0aBooks and readingvFiction. 0aBook clubs (Discussion groups)vFiction. 0aRare booksvFiction. 0aFairy talesvFiction. 0aVirginiavFiction. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aCozy mysteries.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.1 aAdams, Ellery.tBook retreat mysteries ;v6.  c(OCoLC)1225190530  c4706d4706
