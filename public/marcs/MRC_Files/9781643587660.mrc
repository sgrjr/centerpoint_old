Marriage meant giving up on teaching, but Abigail always believed she was meant to be more than a good wife and mother. When Abigail becomes the primary breadwinner for her growing family, what she sees as a working woman appalls her -- and prompts her to devote her life to fighting for the rights of women, including the right to vote."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomenxSuffragevFiction. 0aWomen's rightsvFiction. 0aNewspapersvFiction. 0aWestern stories. 0aWomenvFiction. 0aChristian fiction. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193113013  c4634d4634
