Jacqueline was her mother's perfect daughter--polite and quiet, always dressed as a princess. If her mother was sometimes a little strict, it's because crafting the perfect daughter takes discipline. Jillian was her father's perfect daughter--adventurous, thrill-seeking, and a bit of a tom-boy. He really would have preferred a son, but you work with what you've got. They were five when they learned that grown-ups can't be trusted. They were twelve when they walked down the impossible staircase and discovered that the pretense of love can never be enough to prepare you a life filled with magic in a land filled with mad scientists and death and choices"--Provided by publisher.  aAlex Award winner, 2018 0aSistersvFiction. 0aTwinsvFiction. 0aBoarding schoolsvFiction. 0aSchoolsvFiction. 0aMagicvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFantasy fiction.2lcgft 7aNovels.2lcgft1 aMcGuire, Seanan.tWayward children ;v2.  c(OCoLC)1128194407
