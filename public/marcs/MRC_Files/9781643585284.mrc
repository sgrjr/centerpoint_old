Nor can they anticipate the mountains that will threaten to bury them. Their courtship unwittingly shadowed by murder and betrayal, Priscilla and Aquila slowly work to build a community of believers, while their lives grow increasingly complicated thanks to a shaggy dog, a mysterious runaway, and a ruthless foe desperate for love. But when they're banished from their home by a capricious emperor, they must join forces with an unusual rabbi named Paul and fight to turn treachery into redemption"--Provided by publisher. 0aRabbisvFiction. 0aChurch historyyPrimitive and early church, ca. 30-600vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1129458992
