It's a magical spot, especially in the summertime. Once the town was the home of the Clark sisters-brought up by their grandmother at the Moonglow Inn. Nicknamed "The Moonglow Sisters", as children they were inseparable. Then, a wedding-day betrayal tore them apart and they scattered across the globe and away from each other. But the sisters have at last come home. There's Maddie: smart, sensible, and stubborn. Shelley, who ran off to find her bliss. And Gia, a free-spirit determined to keep the peace. It's her impending wedding that keeps them together. But Gia has a secret, and when her sisters find out all heck is going to break loose!"--Provided by publisher. 0aSistersvFiction. 0aHomecomingvFiction. 0aGrandmothersxDiseasesvFiction. 0aBetrayalvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aTexasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179258573  c4538d4538
