Bandits pillaged and plundered. Gambling dens and brothels flourished openly. Men drank and died from the devil's brew of blood and whiskey, gunsmoke and gold! Into this bullet-spattered hell Rance Hatfield brought the law of the Rangers. They warned him to "git!" They sent their slickest gunmen to trap him. But they didn't know Rance. While women trembled and men dove for cover, he matched his crushing fists and lightning draw against the deadliest desperadoes the Southwest had ever known!"--cProvided by publisher. 0aArizonavFiction. 0aOutlawsvFiction. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225192693  c4709d4709
