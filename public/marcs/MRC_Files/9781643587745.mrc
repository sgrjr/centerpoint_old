She returns to her bleak home, grief-stricken and unmoored. With her teenage daughters rebelling, her testy mother-in-law scrutinizing her every move, and her marriage grown cold, Lydia is restless and yearning for something more. All of that changes with the arrival of her son's tutor, Branwell Brontë, brother of her daughters' governess, Miss Anne Brontë and those other writerly sisters, Charlotte and Emily. Branwell has his own demons to contend with -- including living up to the ideals of his intelligent family -- but his presence is a breath of fresh air for Lydia. Handsome, passionate, and uninhibited by social conventions, he's also twenty-five to her forty-three. A love of poetry, music, and theatre bring mistress and tutor together, and Branwell's colorful tales of his sisters' elaborate play-acting and made-up worlds form the backdrop for seduction. But Lydia's new taste of passion comes with consequences. As Branwell's inner turmoil rises to the surface, his behavior grows erratic and dangerous, and whispers of their passionate relationship spout from her servants' lips, reaching all three protective Brontë sisters. Soon, it falls on Lydia to save not just her reputation, but her way of life, before those clever girls reveal all her secrets in their novels. Unfortunately, she might be too late."--cProvided by publisher.10aBrontë, Patrick Branwell,|d1817-1848,d1817-1848vFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aGriefvFiction. 0aAdulteryvFiction. 0aTutors and tutoringvFiction. 0aMay-December romancesvFiction. 0aSelf-realization in womenvFiction. 0aYorkshire (England)xHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201674220  c4670d4670
