A native Pittsburgher and engineer, he's always believed in logic, sacrifice, and hard work. Now, seventy-five and retired, he feels the world has passed him by. It's 1998, the American century is ending, and nothing is simple anymore. His children are distant, their unhappiness a mystery. Only his wife Emily and dog Rufus stand by him. Once so confident, as Henry's strength and memory desert him, he weighs his dreams against his regrets and is left with questions he can't answer: Is he a good man? Has he done right by the people he loves? And with time running out, what, realistically, can he hope for? Like Emily, Alone, Henry, Himself is a wry, warmhearted portrait of an American original who believes he's reached a dead end only to discover life is full of surprises"--Provided by publisher. 0aOlder menvFiction. 0aAgingvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1135589632  c4451d4451
