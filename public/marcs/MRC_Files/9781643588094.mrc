It's the perfect season for one irrepressible maedel to try an unexpected match ... Good-hearted and impulsive, twenty-year-old Lizzie Fisher has many chores--and secrets. She's caring for kittens abandoned by their mother and practicing her drawing talent away from disapproving eyes. So the last thing she needs is someone like handsome Stephen Zimmerman constantly helping her out of trouble. But when she discovers they both have lovelorn siblings, she has an idea: why can't she and Stephen bring his older brother and her older sister together? After all, how hard could matchmaking be? Even though he's the youngest son of an Old Order Mennonite family, Stephen is used to looking out for everyone else. Yet somehow the romantic schemes he and Lizzie cook up keep going awry--in ways that hint they may suit each other. But their deepening bond is both delightful and complicated. For bridging their differences will take bravery, compromise--and faith in their hopes and dreams ... 0aAmishvFiction. 0aMarylandvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aMennonitesvFiction. 0aChristian fiction. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aReligious fiction.2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225191096  c4703d4703
