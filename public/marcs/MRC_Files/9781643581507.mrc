The result of these pastoral wanderings was his masterful creation of The Wind in the Willows, the enduring classic of children's literature; a cautionary tale for adult readers; a warning of the fragility of the English countryside; and an expression of fear at threatened social changes that, in the aftermath of the World War I, became a reality. Like its remarkable author, the book balances maverick tendencies with conservatism. Kenneth Grahame was an Edwardian pantheist whose work has a timeless appeal, an escapist whose withdrawal from reality took the form of time travel into his own past" -- goodreads.10aGrahame, Kenneth,d1859-1932. 0aAuthors, Englishy20th centuryvBiography. 0aLarge type books. 7aBiographies.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1080546880
