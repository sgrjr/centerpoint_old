She's never even seen the ocean before, but Eva Cassidy has her reasons for making the crossing to Hawaii, and they run a lot deeper than escaping a harsh Michigan winter. Newly enlisted as an Army Corps nurse, Eva is stunned by the splendor she experiences aboard the steamship SS Lurline; even more so by Lt. Clark Spencer, a man she is drawn to but who clearly has secrets of his own. But Eva's past - and the future she's trying to create - means that she's not free to follow her heart. Clark is a navy intelligence officer, and he warns her that the United States won't be able to hold off joining the war for long, but nothing can prepare them for the surprise attack that will change the world they know."--cProvided by publisher.10aUnited States.bArmy Nurse CorpsvFiction.10aUnited States.bArmyxNursesvFiction. 0aPearl Harbor (Hawaii), Attack on, 1941vFiction. 0aHawaiivFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1085151507
