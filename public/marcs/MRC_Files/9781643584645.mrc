To make matters worse, the deadline for his second book has come and gone, and he still hasn't written a single word. When Daniel inherits an old camera from his grandfather, he notices an inscription on the bottom: "No matter what you think you might see, the camera never lies." Daniel begins using the camera, but every time he develops his photos, they threaten to reveal secrets that could sabotage both his marriage and his career-exposing him as a fraud and destroying the life he has worked so hard to build. He's faced with a choice: keep his secrets and save his career or come clean and possibly save his family"--Provided by publisher. 0aAuthorsvFiction. 0aMarriage counselorsvFiction. 0aSpousesvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aSingle-lens reflex camerasvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1122804032
