How does one choose between the life she has and the life she wants? Especially when she's so utterly vexed by the handsome scoundrel who's just arrived in Eden. Rhett Laughlin intends to fulfill a dream and open a profitable restaurant in the growing town. Instead, he's marched right into trouble with one of Eden's most eligible bachelorettes. But as much as Lavinia Brinkman is making things difficult, Rhett can't keep himself from thinking about her. With every spirited encounter, the animosity between Rhett and Lavinia is starting to look a lot like attraction.  0aSistersvFiction. 0aRestaurateursvFiction. 0aMillinery workersvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aRancheszColoradovFiction. 0aEighteen eightiesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aEden (Colo.)xHistoryy19th centuryvFiction. 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1038479229
