Upon discovering that she is expecting a second child, Lucy and Robert are delighted. In anticipation of the new arrival, Lucy is set on expanding her nursery staff. When Agnes, her current nurse, recommends her cousin, it seems like the perfect solution. But trouble arrives along with the new nursery maid from London. Polly's flirtations provoke fisticuffs in the servants' hall and tumult in the village tavern, and on her afternoon off, she fails to return to the Kurland Estate. When a farmer finds her lifeless body in a drainage ditch, Lucy and Robert fear foul play"--Provided by publisher. 0aNanniesvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aAristocracy (Social class)vFiction. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryyRegency, 1811-1820vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft1 aLloyd, Catherine,d1963-tKurland St. Mary mystery.  c(OCoLC)1129459019
