She's excited to spend the holidays taking in the magnificent British sights, but what she doesn't expect is to become instantly attracted to a certain Private Secretary and his charming accent and unyielding formality. Malcolm Hudson has been the Queen's Private Secretary for years and has never given a personal, private tour ... until now. He is intrigued by Vivian the moment he meets her and finds himself making excuses just to spend time with her. When flirtatious banter turns into a kiss under the mistletoe, things snowball into a full-on fling. Despite a ticking timer on their holiday romance, they are completely fine with ending their short, steamy fling come New Year's Day...or are they?"--cProvided by publisher. 0aDating (Social customs)vFiction. 0aVacationszEnglandvFiction. 0aRoyal householdszGreat BritainvFiction. 0aPrivate secretariesvFiction. 0aAfrican AmericansvFiction. 0aSocial workersvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aChristmas fiction.2lcgft 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1113405724
