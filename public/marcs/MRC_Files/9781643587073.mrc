Dorcas Beiler's reckless teenage years are far behind her. She's serious and responsible now, and the good people of Promise Glen trust her with the education of their children. But when her first love returns after years of exile from the community, her past comes rushing back. Thomas is the only one who knows her secret, and despite his careless charm and teasing manner, she refuses to let her guard down. Thomas Fisher has plans. Plans to start a construction company and prove himself a success to all those who doubted him, and plans to find the woman he left behind. His chance comes when he lands the opportunity to rebuild the stable and shed at the community school. He won't be paid for his time, but he'll be able to showcase his abilities ... and spend time with Dorcas. Scenting love in the air, Dorcas's young pupils make excuses to bring them together. As old feelings stir, Dorcas and Thomas wonder whether their first love might also be their last"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen teachersvFiction. 0aFirst lovesvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aAmishzPennsylvaniavFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aPennsylvaniavFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1193124795  c4586d4586
