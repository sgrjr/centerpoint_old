Former Secret Service agent Verity Kent is finding that life after wartime offers its own share of danger when her friend Ada's husband is killed with Ada's revolver, making her the prime suspect. While striving to prove Ada's innocence, Verity is called upon for another favor when the sister of a former Secret Service colleague is killed in what authorities believe was a home invasion gone wrong. The victim's war work-censoring letters sent by soldiers from the front-exposed her to sensitive, disturbing material. Verity begins to suspect these two unlikely cases may be linked. But as the connections deepen, the consequences-not just for Verity, but for Britain-grow more menacing than she could have imagined"--Provided by publisher.10aGreat Britain.bMI6xOfficials and employeesvFiction. 0aWomen private investigatorsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft1 aHuber, Anna Lee.tVerity Kent mystery.  c(OCoLC)1113439372
