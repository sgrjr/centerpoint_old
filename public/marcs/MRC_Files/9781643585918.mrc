As a Washington, DC, OB/GYN at a prestigious hospital, she uses her career to distract herself from her grief over her granny's death and her breakup from her long-term boyfriend after her free-spirited mother moves in with her. But when she makes a medical decision that disparages the hospital, she is forced to go on a short sabbatical. Never one to wallow, Diana decides to use the break to put order in her life, when her mother, Margo, stumbles upon a box of letters from her grandfather, Antonio Cruz, to her grandmother from the 1940s. The two women always believed that Antonio died in World War II, but the letters reveal otherwise. When they learn that he lived through the war, and that they have surviving relatives in the Philippines, Diana becomes determined to connect with the family that she never knew existed, though Margo refuses to face her history. But Diana pushes on, and heads on a once-in-a-lifetime trip that challenges her identity, family history, and her idea of romantic love that could change her life forever"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen physiciansvFiction. 0aFilipino AmericansvFiction. 0aTravelvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aWashington (D.C.)vFiction. 0aPhilippinesvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aChick lit.  c(OCoLC)1137851802  c4482d4482
