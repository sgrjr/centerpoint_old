Beck is everything Joe has ever wanted. She's gorgeous, tough, razor-smart, and as sexy as his wildest dreams. Beck doesn't know it yet, but she's perfect for him, and soon she can't resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom made for her. But there's more to Joe than Beck realizes, and much more to Beck than her oh-so-perfect facade. Their mutual obsession quickly spirals into a whirlwind of deadly consequences. A chilling account of unrelenting passion, Caroline Kepnes's You is a perversely romantic thriller that's more dangerously clever than any you've read before"--Provided by publisher. 0aWomen authorsvFiction. 0aBookstoresvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aSexual attractionvFiction. 0aSecrecyvFiction. 0aBookstoresxEmployeesvFiction. 0aEast Village (New York, N.Y.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1179270881  c4542d4542
