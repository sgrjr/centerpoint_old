She tries to keep up with her studies, her friends, and her hot-tempered roommate, Ellie, who regularly courts trouble with the law. When a male student's remains are found in alligator-infested waters, the university warns students to stay away from the reptiles. But then a second body shows up, and the link is undeniable. Both men belonged to the same fraternity and had a reputation for preying on and hurting women. Ellie has previously threatened to kill men who don't take no for an answer. Rebecca and her friends thought Ellie was kidding. But now a vigilante killer is roaming campus -- someone who knows how to dispose of rapists. Someone determined to save female students from horrible crimes. With each passing day, those who know Ellie become more convinced she's responsible. But if she is, stopping her might not be in everyone's best interest."--cProvided by publisher. 0aWomen journalistsvFiction. 0aCollege studentsvFiction. 0aVigilantesvFiction. 0aSerial murdersvFiction. 0aFloridavFiction. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1201667484  c4681d4681
