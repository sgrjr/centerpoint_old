The day her doctor says the one word that no one wants to hear, Amy Bergstrom discovers a secret that her husband of 25 years has been keeping from her. Now that the months of treatment and surgeries are behind her, she escapes her claustrophobic life seeking healing, peace and clarity in an ancient forest in Washington State, a forest that holds memories of her childhood summers. After dropping off his daughter at Amy's Aunt Rae's horse ranch in the mountains of New Mexico, Officer Paul Bergstrom visits the fixer-upper he had bought years ago as a place to retire with his family. Although it appears fine on the outside, the inside is a disaster-just like his marriage. When he finds himself with more off-duty time than he expected, he lovingly repairs his dream home, building the future he so desperately wants. Witnessing her mother's health crisis had been terrifying enough, but learning the cause was genetic leaves Carly with the sense that all of her dreams are pointless. With the help of her eccentric great aunt and a Clydesdale named T. Rex, Carly just may find her faith in her future again. Amy, Paul, and Carly discover that love and family are worth keeping in this powerful, emotional, and hopeful novel"--cProvided by publisher. 0aBreastxCancerxPatientsvFiction. 0aBuildingsxRepair and reconstructionvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 0aOklahoma City (Okla.)vFiction. 0aWashington (State)vFiction. 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1225192940  aREADY FOR QC  c4731d4731
