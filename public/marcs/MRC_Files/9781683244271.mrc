She spends most nights in her backyard, gazing at the stars. She's on the brink of starting a relationship with a local carpenter, Nash, when she gets new neighbors for the summer, the most unexpected of whom are her ex-husband, his new wife, and step-daughter. As Darcy is drawn into the lives of her neighbors, she develops a crush on another vacationer, Clive, a musicologist visiting with his grandmother. Over the course of the summer, Darcy is driven to decide what she truly wants--is she over her ex? Will she choose Nash or Clive? 0aNantucket Island (Mass.)vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Sagas.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Romance / Contemporary.2bisacsh 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0978295360
