The maid's death is ruled an accident, and the newlyweds put it behind them to begin a whirlwind life zipping between London's Mayfair, chic Paris and hedonistic Berlin. Accompanying Diana as her lady's maid is Louisa Cannon, as well as a coterie of friends, family and hangers on, from Nancy Mitford to Evelyn Waugh. When a second victim is found in Paris in 1931, Louisa begins to see links with the death of the maid two years previously. Now she must convince the Mitford sisters that a murderer could be within their midst ... all while shadows darken across Europe, and within the heart of Diana Mitford herself"--Provided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references.10aMosley, Diana,d1910-2003vFiction.30aMitford familyvFiction. 0aSistersvFiction. 0aMarried womenvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aScandalsvFiction. 0aNineteen twentiesvFiction. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryyGeorge V, 1910-1936vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1129458704
