Then, in a matter of seconds, Brooke's life is shattered when she's carjacked. Helpless and terrified, all Brooke can do is watch as Etta, still strapped in her seat, disappears into the Los Angeles night. Miles away, Etta is found by Molly, a homeless teen who is all too used to darkness ... As unpredictable as her life is, she's stunned to find Etta, abandoned and alone. Shielding the little girl from more than the elements, Molly must put herself in harm's way to protect a child as lost as she is."--Provided by publisher. 0aCarjackingvFiction. 0aMissing childrenvFiction. 0aHomeless teenagersvFiction. 0aSingle mothersvFiction. 0aDivorced mothersvFiction. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aLos Angeles (Calif.)vFiction. 0aSuspense fiction. 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1225193022  c4701d4701
