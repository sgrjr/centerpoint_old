Paris, 2017: Ottoman flags have been flying over the great city for three hundred years, ever since its fall-along with all of Europe-to the empire's all-conquering army. Notre Dame has been renamed the Fatih Mosque. Public spaces are segregated by gender. And Kamal Arslan Agha, a feted officer in the sultan's secret police, is starting to question his orders. Rumors of an impending war with the Christian Republic of America, attacks by violent extremists, and economic collapse have heightened surveillance and arrests across the empire. Tasked with surveying potential threats, Kamal has a heavy caseload-and conscience. When a mysterious stranger-naked, covered in strange tattoos-appears on the banks of the Seine, Kamal is called in to investigate. But what he discovers is a secret buried in the empire's past, a secret the Sultan will do anything to silence"--Provided by publisher. 0aTime travelvFiction. 0aTurkeyxHistoryyOttoman Empire, 1288-1918vFiction. 0aIstanbul (Turkey)y17th centuryvFiction. 0aParis (France)y21st centuryvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aSuspense fiction.2gsafd 7aScience fiction.2lcgft 7aAlternative histories (Fiction)2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1128195940
