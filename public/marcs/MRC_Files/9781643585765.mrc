And Jim was carrying on Roger's fight against dictatorial Russ Mosely in the feud over the conflicting land grants to former Spanish landholders which affected the lives of nearly all the settlers on Tincup Creek. He had carried it to the point where his own life was worth not much more than a dime. Pretty Anne Elliot, slender and spirited and a complete lady, as well as Carl Roger's niece, arrived in Blanco just in time to see Jim Silcott engage in an unequal gunfight with three Hat T roughnecks. After she learns some of the recent history, Anne decides to take over the Sentinel and run it herself. For a time, she is undecided who is in the right. Once she decides, she will champion his cause to the crashing climax in historic Santa Fe"--Provided by publisher. 0aEditorsvFiction. 0aGangstersvFiction. 0aGunfightsvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft 7aWestern stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)1135613676  c4471d4471
