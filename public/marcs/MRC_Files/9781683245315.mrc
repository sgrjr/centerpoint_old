Others won't ever go away. For renowned actor Sir Mungo, his quiet home village in Devon provides the perfect retreat. Close by are his brother and his wife, and the rural location makes his home the ideal getaway for his old friends in London. Among those is Kit, who comes to stay for the summer, bringing with her a letter from her first and only love, Jake, and a heart in turmoil. Years have passed since they last saw each other, and now he has written to Kit asking to meet again. As the summer unfolds, secrets are uncovered that will shatter the sleepy community, and even tear a family apart. But those involved soon realize that the only way to move forward might be to confront the past."--cProvided by publisher. 0aActorsvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aCountry lifezEnglandzDevonvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aFICTION / Contemporary Women.2bisacsh 7aFICTION / Romance / Contemporary.2bisacsh 7aLove stories.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0992562279
