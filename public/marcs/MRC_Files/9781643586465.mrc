The Texans fought long and hard to win victory over Mexico. They had won independence at last, and now bent to the task of building their war-wasted land. They were strong, young men, browned by the sun, and adventurous of heart - fresh from the terrible battles of Goliad, the Alamo and San Jacinto. They were poor, but flushed with victory; they were determined to make Texas grow and flourish. This is the magnificent story of one of them - Lance Meredith - of his struggle to tame the land and defend if from Mexican raiders and savage Indians. It is a story of incredible heroism, hardship - and Victory - and is perhaps Paul Evan Lehman's greatest navel of the Old West"-- Provided by publisher. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifezTexasvFiction. 0aTexasxHistoryyRepublic, 1836-1846vFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aWestern stories.2gsafd 7aWestern fiction.2lcgft  c(OCoLC)1142529574  c4533d4533
