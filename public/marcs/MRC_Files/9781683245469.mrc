When she is hired to pose as a conservator at the Pink Palace Museum in order to test their security weaknesses after some artifacts go missing, she's ecstatic. But when her investigative focus turns from theft to murder, Kelsey knows she's out of her league--and possibly in the cross hairs. 0aSecurity consultantszTennesseezMemphisvFiction. 0aCold cases (Criminal investigation)zTennesseezMemphisvFiction. 0aLarge type books. 7aChristian fiction.2gsafd 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd  c(OCoLC)0990248488
