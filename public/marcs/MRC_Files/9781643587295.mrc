"Whenever I came up with a funny bit, whether it happened on a stage, in a conversation, or working it out on my preferred canvas, the big yellow legal pad, I kept it in one of those old school accordion folders," Seinfeld writes. "So I have everything I thought was worth saving from forty-five years of hacking away at this for all I was worth." For this book, Jerry Seinfeld has selected his favorite material, organized decade by decade. In page after hilarious page, one brilliantly crafted observation after another, readers will witness the evolution of one of the great comedians of our time and gain new insights into the thrilling but unforgiving art of writing stand-up comedy."--cProvided by publisher.10aSeinfeld, Jerry. 0aAmerican wit and humor. 0aComedianszUntied States. 0aStand-up comedy. 0aLarge type books.  c(OCoLC)1193114495  c4632d4632
